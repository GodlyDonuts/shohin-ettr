"""Async streaming dataloader for zstd uint16 shards — DOMAIN-INTERLEAVED.

Each shard holds ~200M contiguous tokens of ONE domain (finemath / openwebmath / code). Serving
shards whole (the old behavior) means the model trains on 200M tokens of a single domain, over-
specializes, then takes a loss shock at the next domain boundary — which destabilizes a small,
lightly-trained model (this was the root cause of the recurring ~step-6400 divergence). So instead
we keep one continuous read stream PER DOMAIN and assemble every batch round-robin across domains,
guaranteeing each batch is a code+math+web blend. This both removes the domain-shift cliff and is
standard good practice (mixed-domain batches train better).

A background thread decompresses shards and builds batches into a bounded queue so CPU
decompression overlaps GPU compute.
