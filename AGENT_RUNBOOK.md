## 0. The mission and the governing directive

**Mission:** Ship the best sub-200M-parameter (currently 125.1M trained parameters) verifiable-reasoning language model of
2026 — math / code / logic. Concretely: **beat MobileLLM-R1-140M** on GSM8K / MATH-500 / HumanEval /
MBPP / logic. Reasoning specialist, verifiable-first. Data must be decontaminated, execution/answer-
verified, concise-CoT.

**Governing directive (verbatim, from the user — this overrides earlier plans):**

> "Forget the cluster that is not possible. So put all your effort into making our pretraining as
> perfect as it can be on the single GPU. Train it for weeks I dont mind. The only thing that matters
> is SoTA."

**Superseding user authorization (2026-07-12):** "we can use 2 GPU's if you want for training (it will be faster)."
It authorizes the validated two-H100 path at a **natural** handoff and for isolated experiments; it does
not authorize interrupting or modifying the running one-H100 writer.

**Superseding reasoning-research directive (2026-07-15):** stop treating established methods as the
frontier and derive the capability from mathematical theory before choosing an architecture. The enforceable
contract is `R12_REASONING_INVENTION_CHARTER.md`: known methods remain matched controls, architecture-first
proposals are rejected, and no implementation advances without a theorem, equivalence dossier, exact collapse
test, and finite CPU falsifier. This does not authorize unsupported SoTA or world-first claims.

**Superseding creative-research directive (2026-07-16):** GPU use is unrestricted; use as much H100
compute as a strong experiment or final recipe requires. The constraint is intellectual, not budgetary: do not make
undifferentiated compute, another token extension, broad SFT, or a sweep the hypothesis itself. Raw capability stayed
flat from 200k to 300k, so every costly run must instantiate a sharper architectural or data mechanism. Prioritize
(1) verified transition/reuse data rather than answer imitation, (2) an architecture that must carry and update state
after source deletion, (3) exact mechanism/control gates, and (4) fresh researcher-written conversations. Start with
the smallest fit that can falsify a mechanism, then scale aggressively when causal, held-out, preservation, and
transcript evidence justifies it.

What that means operationally, and is now settled — **do not relitigate:**
- **Protected current writer is the validated two-H100 successor.** `685084` exited cleanly and
  `686732` now runs two H100s with the same 524,288-token global update, fresh-optimizer rewarmup,
  verified DDP/CUDA health, and single-writer safety. The 8xH100 path remains unavailable.
- **Time is unlimited.** Weeks are fine. Optimize for final quality, not speed.
- **The protected 300k base remains immutable, but architecture research is open in isolated branches.**
  More tokens and better data remain available levers, not the only hypotheses. A new architecture or training
  mechanism may use substantial GPU compute after its distinguishing causal prediction survives the bounded gate;
  it must never overwrite the base or share its output path.

**Most recent user instruction (2026-07-07, `/goal`):**
> "I need you to do highly detailed documentation as you go on so any future agent knows exactly what
> to do. I am also going to go to sleep. I entrust you to take good care of our model."

→ This runbook is that documentation. Keep it detailed and current. **Priority #1 is keeping the
pretrain ALIVE**; priority #2 is executing the milestone transitions in §4 correctly; priority #3 is
keeping this doc accurate.

**2026-07-07 executive-director directive:** the user gave Codex full authority to do whatever is
needed to achieve the project goal. Operationally, this means: protect the live run first; make
bounded, auditable changes without approval loops; prefer verified data and measured gates over
speculative novelty; keep GitHub/Newton/local state synchronized enough that a takeover agent can act.
Do not wait for permission to fix obvious data/training gaps.

## 1. LIVE STATE  ← update this every milestone

| Item | Value (as of 2026-07-15 current custody check) |
|---|---|
| **60k pretrain job** | `680149`, name `shohin-flagship`, node **evc22**, **DONE** (`[done] 60000 steps in 112203s`) |
| **Extended pretrain job** | `683715`, `685084`, and protected two-H100 continuation **`686732`** are complete. `686732` ran on **evc34** with `NG=2 BS=32 ACC=4 CKPT=250`, four CPUs, fresh optimizer rewarmup, the exact 524,288-token global update, distinct post-handoff data stream, and established compile/guard path. It completed 300,000 steps without sharing an output path with capability experiments. No flagship writer is active at this instant. |
| Extended pretrain status | **300,000 complete.** `686732` ended with loss **1.6554**, gnorm **0.11**, LR **0.0005**, and **281.959k tok/s** after 153,869s. The full run represents **157,286,400,000 nominal update tokens**, not unique corpus tokens; mounted manifest capacity remains **57,826,022,271**. The terminal save is model-only. Newton `ckpt_0300000.pt` / `best_step300000.model.pt` and Mac `train/flagship_out/ckpt_0300000.pt` are read-only, 500,448,522 bytes, and match at MD5 **`60de77c31b449060ff0417d8db16d3b0`** / SHA-256 **`211d6b2cddf0c2cf8b12cb0b2d73f9c4440d85f6f531018080c8afd35b2f66a6`**. The 498,688-byte log SHA-256 is **`f359671e256fea784c063747a9d76641384dad8762e4bfae5bf6177fa308669e`**. A future continuation must use fresh optimizer rewarmup. Do not integrate CUDA graphs: the clean canary gained only ~1.8% while removing guard/observability. |
| **SFT feedback job** | `681000`, name `shohin-sft`, **DONE**; wrote baseline `train/sft_out/sft_ep3.pt`. Isolated v2 pilot `685708` completed one epoch from `best_step120000.pt` to `train/sft_v2_120k/sft_ep1.pt`. It is a narrow arithmetic-format ablation, not a promoted broad-reasoning recipe. V4 `686323` was canceled before its first step after stale 40/35/15/10 weights; v4 `686324` was canceled before any artifact after a code-boundary audit found 461/3,542 legacy BPE prompt-prefix mismatches. Both are invalid and preserved. Corrected v4 pilot **`686326`** completed one epoch in 1,218s to `train/sft_v4_168750_r3/sft_ep1.pt`, with audited 40/47/8/5 weights and inference-aligned prompt/completion token construction. It is an unevaluated candidate, not promoted. |
| **Behavior-preserving direct-skill SFT** | **Fit completed, isolated and unevaluated:** `688748` ran from immutable `best_step200000.pt` on evc25, completed one epoch / 4,511 updates in 1,766s, and wrote only `train/sft_retention_v1_200k_r1/sft_ep1.pt` (SHA-256 `46970cdc8692787fe78499bc4a8c7d8b7bd4f3a4b9d29408dd8a14a670f53404`). The candidate freezes the tied embedding/output matrix, trains on 72,161 packed sequences from frozen broad-v4 + verified primitives, and adds raw-logit KL on 4,096 answer-free prompts. Prompt replay was built CPU-only on Stokes job `738692`: SHA-256 `d9c3c355b5fba6b9643d052203ed5d3339dab67563bd8071ba11f12b31076b60`, zero exact overlap against primitive and RG held-out prompts, and no target answers. The corrected CUDA-only evidence chain is raw primitive `688768` (exact 100 rows in each of seven families) -> candidate primitive `688769`; raw balanced 800-case RG `688761` -> candidate `688762`; seven-case raw-vs-candidate interaction `688751` -> eight-case deep transcript `688763`; raw/candidate late-logit lens `688753/688754`; raw/candidate verified visible-thinking audits `688774/688775`; and CPU-only assessor `688776` after all evidence. The trace prompts are 0 exact/13-gram hits across broad-v4 643,595 rows (audit SHA-256 `a2d8e1750cd0e69df2032ff5407afc60a4c13a57bf967823cf98a7be8234b9a7`) and primitives 210,000 rows. Earlier primitive jobs `688749/688757/688759/688765`, RG `688758`, candidate RG `688750`, deep `688752`, and assessors `688764/688767/688770` were canceled or failed before producing a valid report due audited evaluator, balance, schema, or CUDA-fallback defects. Fit loss alone has no standing until the corrected outputs are read. |
| **Retention result (supersedes the stale unevaluated label above)** | **Narrow real signal; reject as broad operator reasoning.** Balanced RG rises raw **31/800 = 3.875%** to retention **143/800 = 17.875%**. The decontaminated twelve-prompt visible-trace audit rises raw **0/12** to **3/12** trace-and-final pairs, and the post-freeze state OOD control rises **0/72 -> 6/72**, concentrated in subtract-multiply-add. But the exact family-balanced primitive gate is only **7/100 arithmetic** and **2/100 base conversion**, under immutable 10% floors; direct interaction remains only **2/7** initial and **0/7** compact reuse. Assessment `688776` correctly records `reject_retention_candidate`; this checkpoint is a behavior-preserving baseline, not a promotion. |
| **Operator-trace v2 COTA result** | **REJECT, with a useful causal diagnosis.** One isolated epoch `688797` from the retained checkpoint writes `train/sft_operator_trace_v2_from_retention_r1/sft_ep1.pt` only. It lifts a template-local state-update primitive to **97/100** but falls to **0/100 arithmetic**, **0/100 base conversion**, **58/800 = 7.25%** held-out RG versus retention's 17.875%, and **0/12** fixed visible trace-and-final pairs versus retention's 3/12. Fresh direct transcripts contain paired-answer grammar in **11** responses (for example `Problem A` / `Problem B`) on ordinary prompts, and initial direct accuracy regresses **2/7 -> 1/7**. `688830` is completing the long 900-case factor record and `688831` will write the hash-bound rejection, but no possible remaining factor score can override these failed preservation, arithmetic/base, trace, and response-mode gates. |
| **Direct-only broad-anchor next test** | CPU-only Stokes build `738713` freezes a new broad candidate from frozen broad-v4 + primitives + operator traces **excluding all `minimal_pair` rows**. The original full-anchor staging attempt was correctly rejected before GPU use after the full consumed-field audit found **4,451** completion-side evaluation 13-gram overlaps; `c74619f` now hard-filters question, response, and completion-prompt text. Commit `197137d` adds a separate source-contract audit: all `operator_trace_contrast` rows must be `direct`, have no `Problem A` / `Problem B` / `The answers are A=` markers in SFT-consumed fields, and satisfy a source-split minimum count. No H100 SFT may start until this data has passed structural, full-text, fixed-trace, state-OOD, factor, and directness reports. |
| **Direct-only broad-anchor result** | **FORMALLY REJECTED; useful response-mode confound removed, no reasoning mechanism established.** Frozen data has 931,348 rows (SHA-256 `1a6a8402052bc78040daf29a03e2a2dca6e26a30bb93bb6b6b9d68f0a1268bde`) and excludes exactly 59,943 minimal-pair rows, with zero paired markers and zero held-out overlap. Isolated `688858` completed 4,943 updates in 1,961s and wrote checkpoint SHA-256 `344f53b27b0bb23524609f31b2b8bb95f701cbef1084a90a5947d25f31a3f3ca`. It modestly lifts RG **143/800 -> 173/800**, but fixed trace-and-final regresses **3/12 -> 0/12**, state OOD **6/72 -> 4/72**, and direct initial accuracy **2/7 -> 1/7**. Factor trace-and-final is wording/value/full **54/300 / 15/300 / 14/300**, with double-add-divide still 0/100 in every full/value cell. Balanced primitives are only **8/100 arithmetic** and **3/100 base conversion**. Deep interaction is 3/8 initial, 3/8 review, 2/8 scaffold, 1/8 reuse. `688866` records `reject_operator_trace_candidate`: removing paired grammar removed leakage but did not produce exact computation or transport. |
| **Matched reflection/control data** | **CPU-ADMITTED BUT DORMANT; no SFT authorized.** Filtered Stokes r2 `738752` contains 57,015 matched rows per arm. Reflection SHA-256 is `627ecbd802a3c7f1cc50346a5871144e2a462f3f54e254ce6cc2c99e7d53616f`; neutral SHA-256 is `ee0816d86b758a4d42be473367b5c9097bfcc542a48a9ca69eead30514298c94`. Response token counts are exactly equal pairwise; prompt token delta is exactly -8 in every pair and is explicitly reported. Audits find zero malformed rows, duplicates, public consumed-field hits, fixed-trace hits, state-OOD hits, or factor-900 hits. The direct-only prerequisite failed, so preserve both arms and do not spend GPU time on them. |
| **FQRB finite-query result** | **CLOSED NEGATIVE.** `688665` completed from raw-200k; its isolated checkpoint SHA-256 is `d732963dde59e224c6f494b503e54a57ec9a81d4b2b1b586a9d212a7095a1c6d`. Combined held-out has only normal/paraphrase/counterfactual **7/4/16** correct rows of 2,500 and **0** strict groups. Train diagnostic recreates normal answers with a zero tape **500/500** and shuffled tape **466/500**; core and magnitude factors likewise show zero strict transport and high zero/shuffle recreation. Direct raw-vs-FQRB is raw **1/7** initial versus FQRB **0/7**, while the eight-case FQRB interview is **0/8** throughout and emits repeated label fragments. The carrier is not causally read, does not preserve ordinary decoding, and cannot support PAAT, ECLI, CWR, CRCS, or a reasoning claim. |
| **R9c bidirectional syndrome result** | **FORMALLY REJECTED; dynamic paths existed but learned syndrome exchange hurt transfer.** Four arms `689259--689262` shared initial adapter SHA-256 `712abd97d22a9a284cf0dbfbf7437cbe2d7bc0c292bdead621f442d7e9b3a9eb`, 328,502 trainable parameters, 4,092 groups / 24,552 examples / 1,023 updates, seed 20260714, and identical base, pointer, tokenizer, and data hashes. Eight frozen evaluations `689266--689273` and assessor `689274` reject treatment. Fresh OOD operation/answer accuracy is treatment **78.29% / 47.77%**, static **80.12% / 51.12%**, no-syndrome **81.14% / 51.79%**, and shuffled-goal **79.58% / 50.89%**. Treatment full-OOD answers are **30.21%**, below the 35% floor, and **88.83%** of wrong operations are agreed-wrong common-mode errors, above the 50% ceiling. Only exact contracts, fit/depth preservation, language floor, query bridge, and adaptive replay pass. Decision SHA-256 is `cb3013800daaeb95b0bc8b2d454b89cf177a4e2dc652633eb0392a625a87b012`; no full R9c fit is authorized. |
| **R10 ACAW/VSPT control** | **DORMANT PRE-SCORE CONTROL; SECOND CUSTODY AUDIT NO-GO; no reasoning or context-scaling success claim.** Commit `a8af84b` implements exact noncommutative version-space composition, sound exact-rational affine ambiguity hulls, query-set annihilator certificates, fail-closed overflow, monotone leaf-local replay, fixed-size all-support commitments, and range-bound retrieval references. Operator/query parity, exhaustive ambiguity, alternate-derivation, overflow reconstruction, and 4,096-event mechanics pass. Canonical accounting separates active-hot, factorized-provenance, external-source, retrieval-reference, and integer-growth bytes. The finite-board replacement passes its local mechanics tests, but independent adversarial review found its evidence custody still forgeable: consumers trusted self-attesting booleans without replaying the build binding; clean committed code identity was enforced only by the optional job; caller-selectable seeds/R5 inputs allowed board shopping; score JSON could be altered and rehashed; several hash-then-reopen paths were TOCTOU-vulnerable; batch/device/determinism identity was incomplete; and source could change between initial and final admission identities. These are claim-blocking even if numerical scores are honest. No R10 probability tensor has been read. Preserve the completed hardening work as a control; do not resume its score chain unless R12 later requires it as a matched comparator. |
| **R11 internal workspace control** | **DORMANT CONTROL; broad draft and v1/v2 were NO-GO; v3 remains an unimplemented preregistration, not a capability result.** The six-slot, 96-wide architecture remains technically feasible as an isolated wrapper with 1,607,334 trainable parameters. V1 failed on an incomplete generator/target contract, leakage and cache risks, ambiguous ledgers, and overclaiming. V2 SHA-256 `11ca769036b2bc85eebd47a950e51b2bc87158668e47ba3cc5e38e4fdae68408` closed many of those gaps but still failed final review: affine-answer/token/frequency rejection conditioned accepted sources on supposedly late-bound queries; the exact API omitted the cached decode session it later required; sham/control primary evaluation semantics were ambiguous; and a seed commitment could not prove confirmation secrecy. V3 closes those contract defects on paper, but its tied recurrence, source-derived slots, and query readers are established machinery rather than an R12 invention. Preserve it as a favorable matched control; no code, board, fit, score, or H100 job is authorized. |
| **R12 mathematical invention frontier** | **SEVEN BOUNDED NO-GOS; RAW VOCABULARY J-WORKSPACE AND MCBS CLOSED AT 300K.** Cursor-action v1 `689932/689936` failed source/cursor binding; final-token readout `689952` fit train but reached only 43.13%/41.67% development. Token-tape `689976` rejects only the frozen pre-final single-query/linear-decoder family. Additive forks and PCRT are theorem-rejected before code. The paired raw-300k future-Jacobian repeat is reproducible but has **0% top-10 and 0% top-100** on all 2,304 decisive targets, so no J-lens swap is authorized. MCBS is also theorem-rejected as a mechanism: for affine consumers it recovers only the observable quotient of the fitted consumers, and a finite answer-specific motor bundle passes projection/complement tests without reusable state. `R12_MINIMAX_CAUSAL_BROADCAST_SUBSPACE_NO_GO.md` freezes the theorem and counterexample. Any successor must be frozen before held-out consumers, held-out updates, and output recoding are revealed. `R12_CERTIFIED_LANGUAGE_BRIDGE_BOUNDARY.md` still blocks synthetic-to-language transfer without a future-reflecting certificate map. |
| **CDRL sample-allocation track** | **CLOSED NEGATIVE ON NEURAL BOARD `R12-CDRL-NEURAL-v1`.** CPU mechanics remain valid. Newton job **`691750`** completed on **evc22** in 3m25s (exit 0). Decision SHA-256 `ad94ac15ca17eaa2c5381aa0a3f94fc60a49dbbf2a528552a1212b3ecf1cabdb` records `advance=false`: median depth-OOD margins core−full **-0.776**, core−hard **-0.778**, core−rand **-0.021** vs required +0.05. Core exact OOD ≈0.04 while full/hard reach ≈0.70–0.92. Pure Nerode-core allocation fails when eval restores distractors. See `R12_CDRL_NEURAL_OPTIMIZATION_RESULT.md`. No Shohin/ACW path touched. Conjecture C closed; do not retune. |
| **Typed controller internalization** | **CORRECTED RESCORE ACTIVE; NO VALID CAPABILITY SCORE YET.** Frozen training has about 54k rows from `best_step200000.pt`. The first completed evaluation `691778` taught the controller grammar and `done=1` behavior (reported done rate 86%), but its apparent final-answer score is invalid because the evaluator stopped at the first arrow and could truncate a multi-digit intermediate. Newton `691782` is rerunning the same isolated SFT checkpoint with fixed decoding and last-arrow fallback. Do not cite its first answer score or promote the checkpoint. Apply the locked ≥35% final, ≥+10pp raw delta, ≥30% SSC rerender, ≥70% atomic, and ≥80% done gates only to the completed hash-bound rescore. Prereg: `R12_TYPED_CONTROLLER_INTERNALIZATION_PREREG.md`. |
| **Post-DRS workspace probe** | **POSITIVE DIAGNOSTIC.** Job **`691756`** completed on **evc33**. Late-layer digit residual swaps yield **10/10** positive directions with ~**+31** Δlogodds at layers 17–29 (raw baseline was ~0). Carry emerges at L29 (+2.96, 10/10). DRS induced an actionable workspace; compounding remains the failure mode. See `R12_DRS_WORKSPACE_PROBE_POST_RESULT.md`. |
| **Track S ACW pilot and baseline custody** | **V6 EXECUTION BASELINE VERIFIED; SCORED REASONING BASELINE NOT YET RUN.** Scientific commit `S=5f5e3cd0d69da67335ad1f1f485c6e3d8f00ff8e` completed producer `740241` on `ec51`; independent verifier `740247` completed on `ec52`. The verifier records different job/node, fresh recomputation, 81 anchored files, receipt payload SHA-256 `f72a40fe2dd84701bfa3f0ea92e3c2b463304861a063507ffb30c7909a6cfca0`, and registry payload SHA-256 `47f233a11db876f6ff26c1b4589a59d31c57bf4b2326b9ac5ffba00b81276cc5`. Registry raw SHA-256 is `66597cf5381fdc11d4ecd73a93d9bbd2fa68417a77b09c1330ecfeb73652451c`; registry-only `A=02c9d4ae57093b6c60d90580503e2a01c7c81619` and execution activation `E=38ebad21cf9c4ef98b172394891c2a35ef671b12` are pushed and installed. E passed the Stokes full-anchor smoke over all 81 files. The pilot has 4,096 histories, 57,344 labels, 12 refinement rounds, 3,400 updates, batch 256, 43,853 candidate evaluations, final losses 2.806958 -> 2.828255, and model tensor SHA-256 `1acc80d4362849d951fb45db34fb5c40c2cbf44a3cce4b7b2fa308b1923a1b94`. These are execution facts only. Custody successor F closes a late review NO-GO without altering the pilot bytes: it replays exactly 24 scored development checkpoints plus three direct-state diagnostics before full confirmation evidence is opened, rejects writable or self-attested baseline JSON, requires the full manifest to bind the exact frozen baseline and authorization, copies the strongest deployable checkpoint mode 0444, excludes the source-retained upper bound from selection, ranks by median depth-64 state exactness then scalar accuracy, and retains the baseline on later NO_GO without overriding promotion gates. No scored development matrix exists yet, so there is not yet a capability-ranked reasoning checkpoint to name. |
| **Track G scored-development custody** | **G1 FAILED CLOSED; THE BOUNDED G2 FOUR-FINDING REPAIR IS LOCAL AND WARNING-STRICT GREEN, BUT COMMIT/INSTALL/RELEASE REMAIN NO-GO PENDING A NEW INDEPENDENT REVIEW; NO SCORE.** G1 `99eaa4c` produced only partial inputs before its exact source ledger rejected an added monitor wrapper that had been classified as modified. Its `acw_development_g1` roots remain failed evidence and are never resumed. The repaired G2 plan raw SHA-256 is `70eafa2de29f62ef6840764207440c8dde90f917cd7917f2613eaadd5081a430`; it is explicitly not ready. Both held chains, `741065`--`741069` and `741070`--`741074`, must never be released or modified. The exact source topology is seven additions and eleven modifications. Verifier commands explicitly require `--verification-replay`, and both verifier receipts are exercised through adjudication. The eventual exact G2 commit must be a sole child of F on dedicated branch/ref `codex/acw-g2`, with exact remote-tracking or verified offline-bundle binding and no caller-selected branch or history rewrite. Shared immutable publication now gives adjudicator records, evaluation JSON, generated datasets, curriculum bundles, and checkpoints unique no-replace staging, file and directory fsync, atomic no-replace publication, descriptor readback, and fatal unexpected I/O. A fresh held allocation and refreeze are required after review before any future release path can exist. |
| **Post-commit interface falsifier** | **V1 STATIC ALGEBRA PASS; V2 POST-COMMIT NO-GO; V3 COMMIT-BOUND PROTOCOL PASS; NO LEARNED-REASONING CLAIM.** Immutable v1 report SHA-256 is **`b7309987cb644bdf31273a07193df56226e35d3653257e239632d7bd837415b4`**. The exact rejected `a9c1f53` v2 artifact remains mode-0444 at SHA-256 **`4f63123028fe33717981d026ca4accc854943400a502e56698ff040145a2ab0d`**. Scientific commit **`36906818f17aa4f03b9f5622dbcb65110ae95abf`** passes all **35/35** frozen gates with two byte-identical **337-role** cores, **27/27** default-deny sandbox probes, exhaustive public state/motor **83,521/83,521**, decisive state **83,521/83,521** versus motor **4,913/83,521**, and depth-nine collapse to **4,913/83,521**. The independent implementation reconstructed all evidence, required Git verification, and alone published the mode-0444 artifact and receipt. Artifact SHA-256 is **`6f3846d6a58bca7d61e753fe1297c9f7090c29ef44f7585716a206dca3bba685`**; receipt SHA-256 is **`55de668bdf4f98b04ad0ce7d20b4e4b06baa53332f2e66b004076fe2b61d63f2`**. This authorizes only a separately preregistered learned packet-lane falsifier. No neural fit, language bridge, autonomous controller, or reasoning result exists. |
| **Learned architecture frontier** | **TRACK S REMAINS PRE-RESULT; REPLACEMENT PILOT `740053` IS A SAME-RUNTIME PROCESS PASS BUT CROSS-RUNTIME CUSTODY NO-GO.** Revision 3 freezes a 26,008-parameter CPU treatment with a three-symbol `F_17` packet, exact one-register writes, source deletion, matched controls, 57,344 labels, and thirteen checkpoints. Commit `b517cf3` completed Stokes job `740053`: both held-live fits, parent recomputation, freeze, reopen, and separate verification completed, and every transferred byte matches between Stokes and Mac. The report records 4,096 histories, 3,400 updates, 44,730 charged candidate evaluations, and model tensor SHA-256 `badacca5fde00e93efb32734101ac257801a370dda9064b8f344343e061fefba`. These numbers have no capability standing. Fresh Mac deterministic replay found exactly eight differing float32 arrays, all by at most one ULP (`5.960464477539063e-08`), while the other 59 arrays and both random projection matrices are byte-identical. The cause is BLAS-dependent summation in event/source one-hot matrix multiplication. Generator protocol v3 uses explicit ordered row addition; Stokes/Mac golden event and complete 4,913-state source-table hashes now match. The v2 artifact is read-only diagnostic evidence and may not be anchored. Production bundle/trainer/adjudicator paths remain hard-blocked. After a valid v3 pilot, the anchor lane must use separately pushed `S -> A -> E` commits: scientific pilot, registry-only anchor, then activation; equality of pilot and training identities is invalid. Static confirmation remains disabled pending a future Beacon protocol. Track C remains the later autonomous-control falsifier. Track D is upgraded conceptually toward a certified learned-cut workspace with DAG-versus-tree proof reuse; it is not implemented or authorized. |
| **Raw 200k / 252.5k / 260k interaction** | **No broad gain, but a source-free renderer-indexed executor is causally confirmed.** The sealed development board remains direct/worked 4/20 and 8/20; its fixed format matrix is `Problem/Work` 44/55 atomic and 10/20 externally scheduled model-carried chains, with crossed-state causality 6/6. Exact patched confirmation `689542` completed all 256 cases / 704 transitions: direct **16/256**, whole `Problem/Work` **9/256**, source-scheduled **115/256**, atomic **534/704**, scheduler-only 101 versus direct-only 2, exact McNemar p **1.05648e-27**. The locked sequential gate failed at **38/64** versus required 45/64; no internalization fit advanced. Whole decoding nevertheless reached the correct answer in **45/256**, lost 36 correct trajectories to continuation/parser behavior, looped/replayed in **214/256**, and all **1,920/1,920** calls hit their cap with zero EOS stops. The external scheduler owns operation selection, state carry, parse, calls, and truncation; this is not autonomous reasoning. Fixed-candidate updater likelihood is independently replayed negative: correct residual state/tail wins **0/6**, while natural prompts prefer arithmetic continuation and packet prompts prefer unchanged copying. Remainder remains a true executor gap at atomic 4/64 and scheduled-local 7/64. See `R12_SOURCE_SCHEDULED_REASONING_CONFIRMATION_RESULT.md`, `R12_SOURCE_SCHEDULED_FAILURE_TAXONOMY.md`, and `R12_UPDATER_CANDIDATE_LIKELIHOOD_RESULT.md`. |
| **Eval board job** | Corrected CUDA-only v2 board **`686277` completed**: GSM8K maj@4 **6/100**, pass@1 **14/100**, MATH-500 **6/100**, HumanEval **6/164**, MBPP **0/100**. The v2 pilot is **rejected for promotion**. RG held-out `686278` is **90/800 = 11.25%** and in-training `686279` is **98/800 = 12.25%**: it learned a few routines that transfer but remains zero on most logic/transformation/cipher/geometry families. The corrected raw-base board **`686315`** pinned `best_step168750.pt` and completed: GSM8K maj@4 **5/100**, pass@1 **2/100**, MATH-500 **2/100**, HumanEval **7/164**, MBPP **0/100**. `686316` direct adaptive interaction was **1/6 initial, 1/6 after explicit self-review, 1/6 with a verified intermediate fact**; only the simple syllogism was correct. V4 r3 public board **`686336` completed and is rejected**: GSM8K maj@4 **5/100**, pass@1 **14/100**, MATH-500 **1/100**, HumanEval **2/164**, MBPP **0/100**. Its corrected held-out procedural result `686337` is **209/800 = 26.125%**, above V2's 90/800 on the same evaluator, but the later raw base means this is a useful diagnostic signal rather than clean data-only attribution. V4 remains a generator/verifier candidate, not a broad promotion. |
| **V5 primitive board** | **`686401` completed; V5 is rejected for broad promotion.** From the raw-168.75k base it scored GSM8K maj@4 **10/100**, greedy **9/100**, MATH-500 **3/100**, HumanEval **2/164**, and MBPP **0/100**. It shows narrow arithmetic-format transfer but regresses code from raw's 7/164 HumanEval and does not establish broad math, code, or instruction-following transfer. |
| **V6 contract SFT** | **`686413` completed cleanly** to `train/sft_v6_contracts_168750_r2/sft_ep1.pt` (4,535 updates, 1,388s). Its fresh 245-case contract holdout `686414` rises from raw **20/245 = 8.16%** to **142/245 = 57.96%**, especially review 28/35, scaffold 34/35, and reuse 34/35. This is deliberately not a latent-reasoning claim: independent deep audit `686415` is only **4/8 initial, 1/8 review, 1/8 scaffold, 0/8 compact reuse** and shows invalid compact calculations. Matched matrix `686438` completed at Q/A **4/48 -> 17/48**, direct **5/48 -> 10/48**, CoT **0/48 -> 21/48**, one-shot **7/48 -> 7/48**; it establishes contract transfer but not compact-state reasoning. No public board is justified. |
| **V7 typed-state SFT** | The fresh solver-verified state corpus has **315,000 train / 10,500 held-out** rows across write, repair, and reuse contracts; independent audit reports 0 malformed rows, duplicate questions, exact held-out prompts, or 13-gram held-out overlap. Raw pinned baseline `686456` completed its 420 rows before a duplicate-output exit: **21/420 = 5.0% answer accuracy and 0/280 valid typed states**. V7 `686467` completed cleanly from `best_step168750.pt`. Its exact 420-prompt holdout `686471` reaches **307/420 = 73.10% answers** and **169/280 = 60.36% exact states**: repair 128/140 answers and 132/140 states, reuse 140/140 answers, but write only 39/140 answers and 37/140 states. The independent eight-case interview `686484` is **1/8 initial, 1/8 review, 1/8 scaffold, and 0/8 compact reuse**, with wrong arithmetic even after a verified fact and malformed/unrelated state text. **Reject V7 as a general-reasoning or latent-compaction candidate.** Keep it isolated as a constructed-contract diagnostic; its hash-matched state/deep artifacts are `1f9fe0b2993d1a9dafc98cd2d7943887` and `c4963fae52d5ac9c38614e77f93f98c8`. |
| **VRWM closed-loop research** | Raw 180k control is **0/400** on the full p80 executable-state suite. r3 one-epoch SFT gives **43/400** closed-loop default prompts but **0/50** paraphrase p10, so it is rejected as template-bound. r4 state-only control gives **32/400 default / 2/400 semantic**; r4 deterministic-scratch variant gives **120/400 default / 21/400 semantic** across value and 4/8/16/32-length OOD regimes. The scratch variant is real narrow executable-state evidence, but its semantic transfer and long-length scores are insufficient for any general-reasoning, latent-reasoning, or promotion claim. Repair-trained r5 SFT `686820` completed cleanly (4,272 steps, 1,303s; checkpoint md5 `ef99f8c2ab5835c8229bcd4f36fb8789`, Newton+local). Its default first pass reaches **174/400**, but semantic first pass and semantic self-repair are both only **17/400**, below r4 scratch's 21/400. Fresh operator interview is **0/8** initial/review/fact/reuse versus raw-180k **1/8** initial and fact: r5 answers ordinary questions with irrelevant `check:/wm:` strings. It is rejected for broad promotion; default self-repair was deliberately canceled after 80/400 because it could not repair that broad-mode failure and was blocking stronger controls. |
| **V8 broad / V9 broad-plus-memory controls** | Raw pinned 180k public board **`686861`** remains running before V8; completed results are GSM8K maj@8 **2/200 = 1.0%**, pass@1 **7/200 = 3.5%**, MATH-500 **5/200 = 2.5%**, HumanEval **7/164 = 4.3%**, with MBPP still running. V8 SFT **`686862`** remains held after that raw baseline. V9 data is **1,213,830** clean/decontaminated rows, 95,163 packed sequences, SHA-256 `8f5845d19d3a3852ed4c7c930b23a27032aaf47e868ef082b7f6f85697b364f4`. Its isolated one-epoch SFT **`686876` completed** to `train/sft_v9_broad_vrwm_180k_r1/sft_ep1.pt` (local/Newton md5 `2a8ddd4dc4f91918eb47dc2701d4b21d`); it loaded 1,213,569 individually fitting examples and skipped 261 frozen rows over 2,048 tokens. Its in-progress board has GSM8K maj@8 **18/200 = 9.0%** and pass@1 **21/200 = 10.5%**, while MATH-500 is still running. That lift is not a promotion: the completed unseen direct interview `686943` is only **1/8 initial, 0/8 review, 1/8 verified fact, 0/8 valid state/reuse**, no better than raw. The transcript-only decoder now retains non-EOS special tokens: V9 emits `<think>` on **9/12** fresh trace prompts but has **0/12** correct intermediates, final answers, or trace-and-final pairs (artifact md5 `6ee477740087c07ab5c0d04b65d28371`). The trace-audit source is `aafd7e5e9aec5ae6dfe83a7ef0c78d66641c1b7add462674f1b30d56382fdf38`; the re-audited V8/V9 frozen prompts retain zero exact/13-gram hits (md5 `49cdf6a0ba055b321637fd1607d9503b` / `1fe9c4ac6faec7aaaff96fd2e7ce4f59`). V9 stays in the chain **`686942` board + `686943` interview -> `686944` default / `686945` semantic memory -> `686946` visible trace -> `686947` decision**. |
| **Semantic bridge / V10 candidate** | Solver-verified semantic-bridge v1 is a **new, isolated data candidate**: 200,000 train and 5,000 held-out rows across product-adjust, state-chain, base-conversion, fact-continuation, and calculation-repair families. Its admission audit `686964` found 0 malformed/duplicate/eval-overlap rows, **17,270,366 tokens**, and **8,432** exact 2,048-token packs. V10 mix build **`686966` completed and admitted the frozen data candidate**: **899,928** rows (math 292,944 / procedural 374,659 / code 7,250 / teacher 25,075 / bridge 200,000), **81,705** exact packed sequences, 0 malformed/duplicate rows, and 0 exact or 13-gram held-out overlaps. Data SHA is `65259560b7c99d95156dc08267c74bd437ee216a2e92826eec60ddc52a9f3a2f`; per-epoch replay is math 0.71x / procedural 1.28x / code 2.46x / teacher 2.04x / bridge 0.97x. V9's full decision is now reject, so the old gating condition is satisfied. The next candidate is deliberately **bridge-only V10A**, one epoch from raw 200k, with hash-bound reports and fresh output. Its isolated chain `687647 -> 687684 -> {687685,687686,687687}` is submitted but still correctly held behind a real CUDA/bf16 preflight; it has no V10A checkpoint or score. `train/eval_semantic_bridge.py` remains the deterministic family-balanced, special-token-preserving held-out gate; a V10A model must improve it **and** direct state-reuse interaction before a public board or broad-mix follow-on. |
| **V10A queue recovery** | Preflight `687647` allocated `evc45`, printed a real H100, then timed out in the Python CUDA/bf16 smoke (`FAILED 124:0`) before any model/data/output work. It is a bad-node infrastructure result, not a capability result. The dependency-dead r1 chain `687684`-`687687` was canceled with no artifacts. `evc45` is now excluded and covered by local static job contracts. Fresh r2 chain is **`687726 -> 687727 -> {687728,687729,687730}`**. `687726` passed the real CUDA/bf16 allocation smoke on `evc48` (H100 PCIe, 81,559 MiB; allocated 37,748,736 bytes) and `687727` is now running the one-epoch bridge-only SFT from immutable `best_step200000.pt` to fresh `train/sft_v10a_bridge_200k_r2`. The independent 500-case bridge, 500-case cross-family composition, and raw-versus-V10A direct-interaction outputs remain dependency-held. No V10A checkpoint or score exists yet. |
| **V10A r2 final decision** | **REJECT.** `687727` cleanly fit one bridge-only epoch from immutable raw 200k to `train/sft_v10a_bridge_200k_r2/sft_ep1.pt`, but this is not a semantic primitive. Checkpoint-bound bridge `687728` is **123/500** answers and **121/500** solver-equation trace contracts: base 35/100, fact 62/100, product 3/100, state 15/100, repair 8/100 (report md5 `9f0fae4c22787a96431b74850c25cb1d`). Independently held-out composition `687729` is **4/500**, only repair-to-chain 4/100; base-then-adjust, fact-to-chain, product-to-chain, and source-dropped named state are 0/100 (md5 `6d073d55325a561b102746ccdccd6651`). Direct `687730` improves raw only narrowly: V10A 3/7 initial, 1/7 review, 3/7 supplied-fact use, and 1/7 state reuse versus raw 1/7, 0/7, 1/7, 0/7 (md5 `c69d8ff98a3c76eac4a2496fbe303475`). V11A, semantic capsule, CWI, anchors, and ISL are blocked. |
| **Semantic-basis transport candidate** | V1 remains preserved as an admitted data artifact but is **controller-ineligible**: its completions include prose around the ledger, so extraction would be an unmeasured controller capability. New **v2 exact-carrier** candidate uses only full `ledger:P=<int>;Q=<int>` completion targets for compile/reflect/update plus exact answers for two consumers. `train/semantic_basis_transport_controller.py` rejects non-full text and forwards the remaining raw emission only by literal replacement; it never parses to calculate, canonicalizes, repairs, or selects a ledger. The isolated H100 wrapper `train/jobs/eval_semantic_basis_transport.sbatch` is static-tested and cannot write a training directory. |
| **Semantic-basis transport v2 result** | **REJECT as a transferable carrier or workspace claim, retain as a real in-distribution causal-execution diagnostic.** The admitted corpus has **150,000 train / 5,000 held-out rows** (30,000 / 1,000 five-phase episodes), clean split audit, and train/held-out/audit SHA-256 `4363101c9773b055e24bce3e79f727f3c103a0fb357a6820206ddeab2567234f` / `6f7dfdfeffc12ddf1ffcb21c12579009d7c00330cbcef54361ab6c4479972a0c` / `d38f443fb3398b2b647060fdd475821849ab43bc94998839babf251f465eb78d`. Raw `687792` is zero throughout. One isolated epoch `687834` fit from immutable 200k in 251 updates / 196s (final loss 0.0168; checkpoint md5 `dfea34f8525d234cce4f3882c986fc61`). Its held-out causal evaluation `687837` yields **198/200** exact compile, **200/200** reflection, **198/200** reportability equality, only **23/200** correct updates, **6/200** full normal transports, **0/100** eligible paired normal transports, and therefore **0/100** raw-model interchange, mismatch, or strict causal passes; report SHA-256 `b643241ea154b49482627e9c6c2e73d20ad17b64422cf5341c06702c7327505e`. In contrast, the completed train-only diagnostic `687853` obtains **200/200** compile/reflection/equality, **194/200** updates, **160/200** normal strict transports, **65/100** model-authored interchanges, and **48/100** strict causal passes; report SHA-256 `b13050b50345834cf0ce861f23facb0c43a3e9753649ee3d0a410001355171ce`. The independent factor matrix rules out a single compound-split artifact: language-only is **1/100**, values-only **3/100**, and delta-only **2/100** strict causal passes, with report SHA-256 `c8decf2e0750ca1438434842589c5eab392a7bd8ac1af65f7f67ae7437507ad5` / `c00b56b3f8bde41e1b8f0d04b1a27d687cb6bd2b48b953df35b5f67f497ad57d` / `e30f9d5301e039aaea1c2bcf6a4806f9ca3c4bcd2730d1874e357971ae83c654`. This is a multi-axis OOD generalization failure, not a controller boundary issue. Hardware/serialization canary `687871` then completed on evc37 from immutable raw 200k with 512 examples / 13 exact packs / 3 updates, no CUDA or serialization failure, and checkpoint md5 `4369ce9f6b4fa3e1ff77d91bbff57003`; it is a launch validation only, not a capability result. The matched full CE-only, same-state, and wrong-state arms are now the only admitted training interventions; reflection and context mechanisms remain blocked. |
| **Semantic capsule / future context-scaling control** | The new semantic-capsule protocol is deliberately distinct from V7/VRWM: it carries two named facts extracted from a natural-language record, then drops that record and repeatedly supplies only the model-produced capsule plus a new event. The controller never executes, repairs, or selects a state. Train/held-out domains, field names, number bands, event language, and lengths are disjoint; held-out regimes are 4/8/12 steps and final queries require retained facts. CPU-only generation **`686991`** and its independent protocol/overlap audit **`686992`** are queued. The audit recomputes every serialized transition and query, then checks all held-out controller prompts (not only initial prompts) for exact and 13-gram train overlap. This is an unadmitted research candidate; no SFT or flagship path references it. |
| **2-H100 speed canary** | `681040`, name `shohin-ddp2-canary`, **COMPLETED cleanly** on evc42: resumed from `ckpt_0060000.pt`, `world=2`, loss in band, no DDP hang, ended at `61050` in 2093s with ~262k tok/s (~1.76x the 1-GPU ~149k tok/s). Latest clean revalidation **`686734`** on evc37 seeded `best_step180000.pt`, loaded the synced forward-stream code, confirmed `world=2`, `BS=32`, `ACC=4`, and `stream_generation=1`, then completed 320 bounded updates with no CUDA/NCCL/DDP error. Its compile-free late windows were **291.7-293.9k tok/s**, about **1.90x** the live 154.3k one-H100 rate; compile-inclusive final logged rate was 243.8k tok/s. It had one guard skip at its terminal step 180,319, so it is a throughput/transport validation rather than a quality result. `686728` is deliberately **not a model result**: both attempts on evc31 failed at `torch.cuda.set_device(local_rank=1)` before model loading, so it was canceled and evc31 joined the preflight blacklist. Current `evc36` idleness is likewise not usable capacity: isolated real-allocation probe `687150` failed with `CUDA-capable device(s) is/are busy or unavailable` after Slurm granted one H100. `686732` is the safeguarded natural successor. Do not confuse idle `evc6`/`evc16` with H100 capacity: they are V100 nodes and the trainer is bf16/H100-oriented. `evc105` is idle 4x H200 NVL, but Slurm rejects this account on `short`/`ucfit`, so it is not usable unless the user's allocation changes. |
| **One-H100 predecessor baseline** | Historical comparison only: `685084` reached **200,000** at loss **1.6200**, gnorm **0.11**, and **154.30k tok/s**, then stayed healthy through observed step **201,270** at **154.29k tok/s**. A direct node read showed 100% H100 utilization with 63,767 / 81,559 MiB used. `ckpt_0200000.pt` and durable Newton `best_step200000.pt` match local `train/flagship_out/ckpt_0200000.pt` at md5 **`510d57df578447986b40e20029511b9d`**. Current two-H100 state and the active DR target are recorded in the rows above. |
| **Current V8/V9 control correction** | Raw board `686861` is **complete** at GSM8K maj@8 **2/200**, pass@1 **7/200**, MATH-500 **5/200**, HumanEval **7/164**, MBPP **0/200**. Replacement V8 SFT `687003` completed one epoch (4,580 updates in 1,496s) to `train/sft_v8_180k_r3/sft_ep1.pt`; its eight-case direct gate `687033` is **0/8 initial** and its held-out trace gate `687034` is **0/12 correct traces/finals**, so it is already ineligible for broad promotion while `687032` records the full board. V9 board `686942` is final: GSM8K **18/200** maj@8 and **21/200** pass@1, MATH-500 **5/200**, HumanEval **5/164** (below raw's 7/164), MBPP **1/200**. Its completed direct 1/8 and visible trace 0/12 gates already block broad promotion. |
| **Current semantic bridge control** | Held-out raw 180k baseline `686978` is **0/500** answers and 0 visible answer-traces. V9 `686979` is **29/500** answers but only **5/500** correct visible trace-and-answer pairs, concentrated in state-chain (20 answers) and fact-continuation (5); it is narrow transfer, not thinking. The completed V9 decision `686947` is **reject**: 1/8 direct, 0/12 verified trace-and-final, no state/reuse gain, and HumanEval regression. This clears the data-gating condition but does not promote V10: V10A is staged as a bridge-only primitive experiment from raw 200k. Its gate now includes the ordinary five-family held-out bridge suite, fresh direct state reuse, and the admitted 500-case cross-family/source-dropped composition suite before any public board. |
| **Current semantic capsule correction** | First 360,000-row build `686991` was rejected by audit `686992` for 884 duplicate no-op-swap prompts; artifacts were preserved under `artifacts/rejected/`, never edited. Corrected CPU build `687009` completed 360,000 rows and 3,000 held-out 4/8/12-step episodes. Independent audit `687010` passed: 0 malformed/duplicate rows, 0 invalid episodes, and 0 exact/13-gram hits across all 30,000 held-out controller prompts. Generic admission `687015` **passed** 360,000 rows, 0 generic overlaps, and 22,899 exact packs. Raw H100 control `687017` failed CUDA preflight on excluded bad node `evc26` before model load; its dependency was canceled. Replacement controls **`687019` raw 180k** and **`687020` V9** both completed **0/300 closed-loop**, with 0 correct initial capsules and 0 correct transitions in every 4/8/12-step semantic regime. This rejects the capsule route as a raw/V9 capability claim. The staged post-bridge `V11A` continuation now refuses raw initialization and requires full, checkpoint-bound V10A bridge plus cross-family composition gates before it can test learned source-deleted state transport. |
| **Continuous latent-rollout pilot** | **Rejected against the required matched answer-only control.** The corrected 96,000-row / 1,800-held-out data admission passed, and mechanics canary `687046` was finite. Matched 24k pilots `687048` (L=0) and `687049` (progressive L=4) then shared a 896-case seed-controlled screen: L=0 scored **190/896 = 21.21%** versus the latent checkpoint's best L=4 **173/896 = 19.31%**. L=4 lost fitted, depth-OOD, and language-OOD accuracy and tied at zero full-OOD. Within-model L=4 movement is therefore non-causal; do not scale answer-only soft-token rollout. Preserve reports md5 `e1c093a51a808c14acb21299fbf8be7b` / `9a516983a4b1cd85bd4bbc96f4f97230`. |
| **Digitwise Recurrent Scratchpad (DRS)** | DRS is the discrete alternative after continuous-packet failures: the model must author one fixed-width decimal microstate per turn (one result digit, carry/borrow, and program counter); the controller only forwards that exact emitted state and never executes or repairs arithmetic. Stokes CPU build **`738117`** committed immutable v1 data: 439,865 train rows and 1,500 held-out counterfactual episodes, structurally solver-valid with zero duplicate normalized prompts. Independent audit **`738120` rejected v1 before GPU use**: it found **27** held-out 13-gram overlaps, each a real shared operand tape across `add`/`sub` operation variants, not a harmless static template hit. Preserve v1 unchanged. The corrected v2 generator reserves `(width,left,right)` across both operations and counterfactual branches, and audit **`738123` passed**: 439,865 train rows, 1,500 held-out episodes, 19,800 controller prompts, and 0 invalid/duplicate/exact/13-gram findings. V2 train/eval SHA-256: `381b8bbf3a4eddb7b08b0f9d4b08ea3ce65e1f0ec48de930632d54417c2f7f35` / `89ce11b36ff2f56e83cda72a1f07b1a90f4a3dc3803c69db2779a27219712646`. To separate algorithmic execution from wording transfer, isolated H100 chain uses `best_step200000.pt`: raw held-out wording, raw core wording on the same episodes, one DRS-only SFT epoch, then matched post-SFT core and held-out wording evaluations. **Both raw controls are complete at 0/500** first transitions, loops, finals, counterfactual finals, and interventions in every 100-episode fit/value/width regime. Core result `digitwise_recurrent_v2_raw200k_core_p100.json` has MD5 `20a5d4cc4a776ee3ffb9220f288f4f6a`; its 34 unique first responses (mode count 265) remain malformed/repetitive rather than a fixed state. Thus neither ordinary nor canonical wording reveals pre-existing protocol competence. Original children `687350/687351` were canceled before start to add the core control. The first replacement SFT `687363` and its children were canceled before allocation after a boundary audit found that their stored script would wrap `completion_prompt` in a second `Question/Answer` frame. Replacement **`687419`** passed the hash-bound and exact-boundary gates but then failed CUDA allocation on **evc44** before model load (`CUDA-capable device(s) is/are busy or unavailable`); it wrote no model artifact and is an infrastructure non-result. Real H100 smoke **`687428`** then passed on **evc49** (CUDA tensor plus bf16 matmul). Current clean chain is **`687430 -> {687431,687432}`**, pinned to evc49 with fresh output paths, hash-bound prompt construction, and a real CUDA preflight. DRS-only excludes `evc23`, `evc32`, and `evc44` in addition to earlier CUDA failures; do not generalize those exclusions to the flagship. The chain cannot alter the flagship output/corpus. A pass would establish only narrow local digitwise execution from a canonical state, not language parsing, broad reasoning, or context scaling. |
| **DRS current causal chain** | Supersedes the obsolete `687430` chain above. Uncompiled isolated SFT **`687459`** completed cleanly on evc49 from immutable `best_step200000.pt`: 439,865 hash-bound rows, 51,131,402 packed tokens, 10,623,342 answer tokens, 24,966 packed sequences, one epoch / **1,561** updates / **1,115s**, output `train/sft_digitwise_recurrent_v2_200k_r3/sft_ep1.pt` MD5 `6f30db16208d274229950b17662dda01`. Fit loss is not a result. Core artifact **`687460`** establishes **275/500** final answers: fit 100/100 (w4), 98/100 (w6); value OOD 34/100 (w4), 43/100 (w6); width OOD 0/100 (w8). Crucially, its first emitted state is right on **497/500** episodes, including 98/100 at width 8, but later state transport compounds errors (353/453 emitted transitions correct before failure at width 8). `687560` then passed a no-data CUDA/bf16 H100 preflight on evc49 in 4 seconds. The gated remaining evidence path is `687562` transcript probe -> `687563` held-out wording -> `687564` direct interaction -> `687565` raw NLL. It is isolated, one-H100 per process, and cannot write the active pretrain output or corpus. |
| **Append-only Delta Ledger (ADL)** | New isolated context-scaling candidate, untrained and **admitted for future isolated GPU use**, but deliberately not submitted before the DRS causal decision. Unlike DRS, a turn emits only `step,digit,carry`; every four model-authored deltas must be compacted by the model into a short block, after which the controller drops the four raw records and transports only the exact block text. The controller does not calculate/rewrite content. The candidate tests whether reducing response copy burden creates an execution foothold and whether a first-level model-authored compaction survives paired counterfactuals. Local protocol/controller, generator, independent audit, and a 40-episode/20-held-out smoke all pass with 0 malformed rows, duplicates, exact prompt hits, and 13-gram overlap. CPU-only Stokes build **`738186`** completed separately named immutable artifacts: **384,000** train rows and **1,000** paired held-out episodes over five 200-episode regimes, with data/heldout SHA-256 `ef317dd5aed85fa83add40a637c52232f4b4daf626e609f88926cb358113cbec` / `3117ec5072134a9bade424499be9ee3a3e504e4f26deec445c3b5b1baeccaca0`. Independent Stokes audit **`738187` passed**: 0 invalid rows/episodes, duplicate normalized prompts, exact prompt hits, or 13-gram overlaps across **42,000** held-out controller prompts; report SHA-256 `5d0e2acd2cfc042de7c76266d048987c347d1e5d22b05e79232fce8ea5c9258f` matches the copy already on Newton. Raw-200k likelihood on a fixed 20-way local `digit,carry` choice is **0/16 top-1**, mean correct rank **10.688/20**, and defaults to `d=0;c=0` under both core/held-out wording; it is a learnability curriculum, not a pre-existing latent arithmetic shortcut. Artifact md5 `9ae4c88aca13079fe69036a47b88e597`. `eval_append_ledger.py`, its paired transport-only unit test, and hash-bound exact-prompt SFT/evaluation wrappers are preflighted but unsubmitted. Recursive block-of-block compression is explicitly deferred until first-level evidence exists. |
| **Current latent-pilot correction** | Corrected generation `687041` and admission `687042` **passed**: **96,000** unique solver-verified answer-only train rows and **1,800** held-out depth-5/6/8 rows, zero malformed/duplicate/exact/13-gram overlaps, training SHA-256 `aa65eefd1dbee25c3c7cec956059a970ea53e079bbc4f4695dd160cacd980fd9`. Mechanics canary `687046` was finite. The matched 24k pilots `687048` (**L=0 control**) and `687049` (**progressive L=4**) are now **rejected** by the shared 896-case, same-seed screen: control L=0 is **190/896 = 21.21%**, while the latent model is **147/896 L=0**, **163/896 L=2**, and **173/896 L=4 = 19.31%**. Its best L=4 result loses fit-IID 46.48% vs 50.39%, depth-OOD 12.50% vs 14.06%, language-OOD 11.72% vs 13.28%, and ties full-OOD at 0%. Within-model L=4 improvement is therefore not evidence; the matched control is stronger. Preserve the two hash-bound reports (md5 `e1c093a51a808c14acb21299fbf8be7b` / `9a516983a4b1cd85bd4bbc96f4f97230`) and do not scale answer-only latent rollout. |
| **Verbalizable Recurrent Workspace (VRW)** | **CLOSED NEGATIVE; do not scale or autoregressively evaluate.** Recurrent `688942` and matched reset `688952` each trained the same 297,217-parameter frozen-base adapter for 1,024 updates / 8,192 examples from immutable 200k, with identical initial adapter SHA-256 `294fd4d40baf74c481fe6575b1df31ae98869373e9fe19a4bfdb4095f6833d09`. Recurrent/reset training took 78s/56s; checkpoint SHA-256 is `0befb586b767cfaf2cdbf77d9115785e7cf90e27f1a46dcec463c26464eb6569` / `859c8b964db14dafc2ccb60c185916785283ab6738a75e68fba827c3709f431b`. On the shared 224-case held-out NLL screen, reset beats recurrent by **0.26736 fit-IID NLL** and **0.26769 depth-OOD NLL**. Recurrent's strongest zero/shuffle state-necessity margin is only **0.00377**, its depth-OOD advantage over one-step/reset inference only **0.01446**, and both adapters have **0 exact sequences** in every regime. All capability gates are false; comparator SHA-256 is `2ec1f81cf0beaf47ed91946d0f0f1e74d4ac84026dd7f010aacd65e4643ca8dc`. The adapter learned a useful prompt-conditioned one-step bias, not a causally specific recurrent workspace. |
| **Causal Microcode Bottleneck (CMB)** | **R1 supplies a causal execution foothold; R2 and R3 are formally rejected; no decoder bridge is authorized.** R1 `688994/688995` gets fit **251/256**, depth OOD **155/192**, language OOD **19/256**, full OOD **1/192**, and 426/896 answers versus 45/896 shuffled, proving exact same-language depth composition but not semantic compilation. R2's matched output-KL treatment is rejected as redundant: control/candidate combined language+full is **11.83% / 12.50%**, exact programs **30/896 / 30/896**, and direct interaction **1/8 / 1/8**. R3 then preserves the anchor, factorizes operation/query kind from register role, and adds signed representation-level `Z2` constraints over 48,000 six-view programs / 288,000 admitted rows. Matched jobs `689070/689071` share base, data, seed, order, schedule, and initial adapter hash and complete 12,000 updates. Control/candidate scores are fit **256/256 / 251/256**, depth **166/192 / 167/192**, language **52/256 / 60/256**, full **20/192 / 19/192**, all answers **494/896 / 497/896**, and exact programs **435/896 / 445/896**. Combined language+full rises only **16.07% -> 17.63% (+1.56pp)** and exact programs **48.55% -> 49.67% (+1.12pp)**, below both locked +5pp attribution gates; both frozen hand-authored interactions are **0/8 answers and 0/8 exact programs**. Post-hoc component diagnosis is still informative: on language OOD, candidate operation-kind rises **69.22% -> 79.69%**, query-kind **45.31% -> 66.41%**, and non-sum query role+kind **2.91% -> 25.58%**, but operation role conditional on a correct kind is unchanged at about **55.7%**; merge-kind remains **7/119** and depth-8 exact programs remain **0/64**. The constraints improve some local semantic factors but do not establish referential operation binding or error-resistant program composition. Comparator `738798`, SHA-256 `11edf7a9565dc3da8cec75d70ae5332b9aef67847839db98bea22763a64f91d4`, records `reject_role_equivariant_compiler_r3`.

| **Binding-First Referential Slot Compilation (R4)** | **FORMALLY REJECTED by the locked absolute full-OOD floor, but it establishes the first large matched mechanism effect and determines R5.** Control `689104` and pointer `689105` each completed 12,000 updates with 300,493 parameters, identical immutable 200k base/data/seed/order/schedule, and identical initial adapter SHA-256 `fd1d2b04607b1d0c81c12551ea9d7667b91b9260453e862370e540344619fabb`. Pointer raises language OOD **29/256 -> 139/256**, full OOD **2/192 -> 51/192**, all answers **479/896 -> 638/896**, and exact programs **469/896 -> 624/896**. Combined language+full rises **6.92% -> 42.41% (+35.49pp)**, all-program exact rises **52.34% -> 69.64% (+17.30pp)**, and operation-role accuracy conditioned on correct kind rises **57.92% -> 100%** with no fit/depth regression. Every matched attribution gate passes except `candidate_absolute_gates`: pointer passes the 50% language floor but misses the 40% full floor at 26.56%; manual is only **1/8 answers / 1/8 exact programs**. Comparator SHA-256 is `890a19c1d9eaad04b5d09b5216f2622a01036ba140c11455bc6837bc23a79d54`; pointer adapter/eval/manual SHA-256 is `0d8bde0ed0691ed7f75158f2219c66153a6a1021128b8586aa484f026cbf5849` / `ed857623ab3bb7840096d50de9e35aceb3d640f02e6ec5adca1937d66513e0a3` / `0c9471cbf43a450455a17d6425d81da35bf626b58afe9a411d27c2d1261cefda`. Factor analysis localizes the remaining failure: operation role is solved, while unseen subtract phrasing is confused with move in **116/123** language and **206/243** full subtraction events. Preserve R4 as validated dynamic binding, but do not call it a complete compiler or authorize a decoder bridge. |
| **Exact future-Jacobian workspace diagnostic** | **Longitudinal mechanics pass; semantic gate fails at raw 200k and raw 300k, so this branch stops before intervention.** Raw-200k jobs `689115/689116/689118` selected layer 13 but had 0% top-10/top-100 on all 2,304 language/full targets. Frozen raw-300k jobs `690028/690030/690031` reproduce the map (within-checkpoint cosine **0.9546--0.9991**, top-16 overlap **0.8619--0.9960**) and select layer 25. Future MRR improves over immediate **0.0004949 vs 0.0001024 (4.83x)** with median rank 2,817, but remains **0% top-10 and 0% top-100**. At the same layer 25, raw-200k future MRR was slightly higher (0.0005352), so this is not monotonic semantic emergence. Cross-checkpoint cosine is 0.6992--0.8233 with top-16 overlap 0.7014--0.9074: a broad causal subspace persists while its map evolves. Artifact SHA-256 values are frozen in `R12_JACOBIAN_WORKSPACE_LONGITUDINAL_RESULT.md`. No coordinate swap or raw-workspace mechanism is authorized. |
| **Future-Effect Operator Algebra (R5 research contract)** | **CPU-only exact contract passes; no language-model result yet.** `train/future_effect_algebra.py` represents every two-register event as a 3x3 homogeneous affine operator over `[register_0, register_1, 1]`, composes chronological chunks by matrix multiplication, and identifies an operator by its effects on future state/query probes. The exact test reproduces all **896/896** held-out answers and proves split-chunk composition is identical after source text is dropped. A label-assisted post-hoc R4 diagnostic shows why argument structure is the next intervention: recasting a predicted move as subtract only when the event contains one rather than two entity arguments changes no fit/depth case and raises pointer language **139 -> 213/256** and full roughly **52 -> 120/192** under the exact algebra. This is development evidence, not a retroactive R4 pass. R5 must infer its argument graph from text-only slots, freeze the rule before a fresh lexical split, and beat equal-parameter/vector or label-head controls before any reasoning claim. |
| **R5 text-only argument-graph gate** | **Development clears the old absolute gates; fresh generalization remains unscored.** Frozen threshold **0.80** infers one/two-entity event incidence from projected token identity and predicted intro slots only; on the development board it raises the unchanged R4 pointer to **252/256 fit, 173/192 depth, 226/256 language, 146/192 full, and 773/896 exact programs**. This is development evidence and cannot promote R5. Before reading fresh scores, the locked gate requires fresh language >=70%, fresh full >=55%, >=15pp answer and >=10pp exact-program gains over the same raw pointer compiler, >=95% fresh arity accuracy, complete operation/query coverage, all original absolute gates, and <=10pp fit/depth regression. Stokes CPU job `738850` is building 448 fresh language/full cases in new domains/templates plus the 448 pinned preservation controls, with zero exact/13-gram overlap against R4 train or development required. Separate structural and mention-label admissions must pass before two read-only H100 evaluations. No future-effect operator fit is authorized until the comparator passes. |
| **R5 fresh argument-graph result** | **FORMALLY REJECTED; do not tune threshold or fit an R5 operator continuation.** Stokes `738850/738851` built and independently admitted 448 new language/full cases plus 448 pinned controls: zero exact/13-gram train/development hits, zero oracle/span/width errors, and complete opcode/query coverage. Matched read-only H100 jobs `689169/689170` used the same pointer adapter and byte-identical board. Raw versus frozen-threshold answers are language **146/256 -> 142/256**, full **50/192 -> 53/192**, fresh combined **196/448 -> 195/448**, and fresh exact programs **174/448 -> 172/448**. The graph recovers fresh one/two-entity arity at **96.61%**, but only **115/408 = 28.19%** raw kind errors cross the arity partition; **293/408** are within-partition. Across 130 changed kinds it corrects 21, harms 23, and maps 86 wrong-to-wrong; at answer level it fixes 7 and breaks 8. Fresh add is only **140/353**, move **299/394**, and swap **264/363** before intervention, dominated by add->subtract/merge and move/swap->merge confusions that arity cannot resolve. Comparator SHA-256 `2e5ac395996068cbb8f4c04e40a8c80bdc15d876028800697765b2e742fc1dbe` records `reject_argument_graph_r5`; failure-analysis SHA-256 is `897c140fc6f325c1eae820542717f2aad4e430cc1f515615daa91a8abf711b2d`. R5 proves argument incidence can be recovered but is not the missing operator semantic. |
| **Source-dropping packet memory** | **Rejected for promotion.** Admitted data has **192,000** train rows and **1,536** held-out rows across IID, length, language, and full OOD regimes; audit reports zero invalid/duplicate/exact train-eval prompt collisions, train SHA-256 `419199a756679e61601c05481ffc59221fba75b601608990539781013a51da64`, eval SHA-256 `6a10a6b27be8dc6b0a36954296d9f33abd099d87bbdff46c251a1357f1c894c3`.

Held-out M1 normal/zero/shuffled was **6/384 / 6/384 / 9/384**. Locked comparator `687088` returned `advance=false`: M1 normal lost to shuffled on IID (**4/96 vs 5/96**) and had no positive margin in length+language (**2/192 vs 3/192 controls**), zero chunk wins, and zero query-kind wins. No source token is present at decode time, but no causal retained-information claim survived. |
| **Certified latent ledger (CLL)** | **V2 is rejected for promotion.** Fresh CPU `687141` completed in **85s** with **223,996** train rows, **7,936** held-out rows, **16,000/384** counterfactual pairs, and zero invalid/duplicate/exact/13-gram/pair findings; train/eval SHA-256 `8760df867b4da98dcc84b356eea8e0d70922e3280e868193216173603814c08c` / `dfcf852c0ca57b6bb58f4f7c1a775221e33e97aa261d79478cc3bf36e82e5fc7`. Hash-bound token report md5 `89ac960e6eb12b0f2dbe25f42a9ee3d1` reduces train chunk/source means **228.60/511.63 -> 41.44/92.74** tokens and held-out means **194.93/660.24 -> 37.43/126.79**. Matched raw-190k M0 `687144` is 11/631 (1.743%) in every mode. Eight-slot M1 `687145` is normal **16/631 = 2.536%**, zero **4/631 = 0.634%**, shuffled **12/631 = 1.902%**. Locked `687148` returns `advance=false`: fit margin **0.79pp <15pp**, length/language **0.63pp <5pp**, **2 <3** chunk wins, and **0/128** correct-and-different intervention pairs. It only meets the weak two-query-kind count. Keep reports (M1 md5 `526e9a2c365ff195bb369fd5c49ae60a`; comparator md5 `bf831f2e8ea4d8528dbe44da6343aac9`) as negative evidence. |
| **Latent state algebra (LSA)** | **Rejected by locked matched comparator `687172`; no stage 2.** The verified-geometry candidate and answer-only control each completed the same 7,163 updates from `best_step190000.pt`. On all-held-out source-removed evaluations, fit-IID normal margin was only **+1.04pp** versus the required +10pp; combined length/language margin **+0.09pp** versus +5pp; equivalent-pair margin **+0.52pp** versus +10pp; and all arms scored **0/576** intervention pairs. It won only two rather than three required chunk counts. The normal packet effect disappears under zero and shuffled-source controls, so it is not causal retained-state evidence. Final reports are mirrored locally/Newton at md5 `af9c6f40d066040a52505fa49cfd9c37`, `2d465a4d38a1aa09cf090f7fab07b90f`, and `6810722f720c1ad8d2874de4e4ff5329`. |
| **DRS transcript gate** | **`687562` completed cleanly** on evc49 in 5m52s; its local/Newton mirrored core transcript artifact SHA-256 is `c36b09f61abc0ec63fe07d7870ea24583120227ad82e53499034f0ac8d75db28`. On 25 paired core episodes it has **25/25 first transitions**, **13/25 final answers**, and the same path-dependent pattern as the full 500-case board: fit w4/w6 **5/5** each; value-OOD w4 **1/5** with four failures at transition 3; value-OOD w6 **2/5** with three failures at transition 5; width-OOD w8 **0/5** with first failures at transitions 2/3/4. One retained value-OOD failure preserved the correct written result digit but dropped the required terminal carry (`c=0` versus `c=1`), and its paired counterfactual also failed. A transcript-retention bug affected only the auxiliary per-regime sample bucket, never scores; it is fixed locally with a passing evaluator test and must be synced before the next transcript-bearing comparison. **`687563` held-out wording is currently running**, followed serially by direct interaction `687564` and raw-NLL `687565`. |
| **Workspace residual-patching baseline** | New read-only diagnostic `train/probe_digitwise_workspace.py` measures whether a last-position residual is an actionable, broadcastable local state: it symmetrically replaces the residual after each selected block with one from a matched held-out DRS transition whose carry or result digit differs, then measures directional next-token log-odds. It is explicitly a late-layer logit-lens proxy, **not** a Jacobian lens or a thinking claim. Raw-200k local-MPS baseline uses 5 held-out regimes x 4 matched pairs x carry/digit x both swap directions = **40 directions per field/layer**; artifact SHA-256 `78b5efa4f3f7fe3ef10104de8d02fdee67f253c805c58f214a4cd1985c495875`, copied Newton/local. Carry deltas are only +0.001 to +0.028 with 18-22/40 positive directions; digit deltas -0.042 to +0.0002 with 14-20/40 positive. The raw model has no stable simple last-token workspace under this test. Matching post-DRS job **`687578`** is held `afterany:687565` with the same 80-direction configuration; it cannot write training data or model output. The static-tape factor evaluator received the same transcript-bucketing repair and passes local/Newton tests before any STRR result is possible. |
| 60k final loss | final logged band ~1.5-1.7; last logged step 59990 loss 1.6989, lr 0.0005 |
| 60k skips | **45 total**, stable/healthy |
| **Corpus-expansion job** | `680324` — **✅ DONE** (finished ~12:10) |
| finemath3 output | `artifacts/shards/finemath3/` — **✅ COMPLETE: 125 shards, exactly 25.0B tokens** (`manifest.json` present, 22 GB; 8,575 contaminated docs dropped vs evalgrams). **Included in the 300k relaunch SHARDS.** |
| SFT mix (Newton) | `artifacts/sft/sft_mix_core.jsonl` — **97,439 examples**, rebuilt 2026-07-08 with hard eval filtering. Audit: 0 malformed rows, 0 duplicate questions, 0 exact eval-prompt hits; builder dropped **206 exact eval-prompt overlaps** and **741 eval 13-gram overlaps** before writing. md5 `53ed91368b4c238dc18a1ab1699e4158`; report md5 `21459b382767801e205f3f625ce106cd`. |
| Local teacher distillers | Nemotron screen run completed at **1,781 rows** but provider health was poor (`kept=19`, `err=52506` in the screen run). Bounded probes after that were also unhealthy: Nemotron `limit=5` kept 0 with 3 provider errors; GLM `limit=3` kept 0 with 3 provider errors. **Leave Nemotron and GLM paused until provider health clears; do not blindly respawn.** HY3 bulk process died/stalled after ~25.2k rows; `conc=2` and `conc=1` restarts exited without appending, even though a tiny direct Hermes/probe call completed cleanly. Claude/minimax snapshots are present. GLM remains the preferred strongest open-weight teacher when available. |
| **Verified-data expansion** | **Active, CPU-only, isolated from pretrain.** `openmath_pt` is complete at **5,000,000,144 tokens / 50 shards** and remains future-relaunch-only. FineWeb-Edu `686298` is a **4,599,762,693-token / 46-shard pilot only**, not an admitted 25B replacement: it must never be mounted as `fineweb_edu_25b` or substituted for a 25B approval. It remains preserved for diagnosis with manifest md5 `05739fa1cb31a45e1c496909f9461fa1`. DCLM-Baseline pilot `686342` and full scan `686360` are **complete and accepted as a pilot only**: **5,000,000,487 tokens / 50 shards**, 3,506,817 kept of 4,203,263 seen, with 1,820 eval-contaminated rows rejected and no entropy or byte-fallback outlier. The ongoing DCLM 25B builder `686529` and Stokes FineWeb r2 builder `738030` are both future-only; each must pass a fresh machine-readable scan and hash-bound approval before a natural handoff. The solver-verified **primitives v1** ablation data is complete: **210,000 train / 3,500 held-out** rows across arithmetic, base conversion, state updates, sort/dedup, string insertion, syllogism, and correction; 0 malformed rows, 0 duplicate normalized questions, and no train/held-out prompt overlap. `rg_v4` has **374,659 valid traces**, 0 malformed rows, and 0 normalized-question duplicates across 25 answer-checked families. CodeContests `686291` completed **3,000** train-only Python examples; its completion-form derivative has **3,593** deduplicated examples. Frozen **v4** has **643,595 clean rows**: math 240,297 / procedural 374,659 / code 3,542 / teacher 25,097. Exact SFT packing `686312` passed at **62,926** sequences. The original 15% code target would replay code 7.7x and teacher 3.1x, so v4 pilot weights are revised to **40/47/8/5** (math/procedural/code/teacher; code ~4.1x, teacher ~1.6x). `686317` is independently scaling more verified CodeContests data for a later mix; it does not alter v4. No new output may enter a frozen SFT mix before its final audit. |
| **25B language replacements** | **FineWeb `686530` is rejected as an undersized replacement:** it used `sample-10BT` and committed only **4,599,748,648 manifest tokens / 46 shards**, not 25B. Preserve it for diagnosis; it is not a future relaunch candidate and its missing machine-readable scan approval cannot be repaired retroactively. The guarded replacement **Stokes CPU `738030`** writes only `artifacts/shards/fineweb_edu_25b_r2.partial`, uses `sample-100BT`, and must prove **>=24.5B** manifest tokens before it may atomically publish `fineweb_edu_25b_r2`. DCLM **`686529`** remains a separate future-only 25B build. Both candidates still require a fresh full scan, matching manifest/report hashes, a hash-bound `*.approved.json`, and <=1% byte fallback before a natural language-data relaunch. Never mix in the 5B pilots. |
| **TACO algorithmic-code gate** | Full pilot audit **`686514` passed**: every one of 250 initially accepted Python programs matched its source record and passed **all** bounded supplied stdin/stdout cases; 0 execution/missing-case/source-unmatched drops, 0 malformed rows, duplicate prompts, exact eval hits, or 13-gram hits. Hash-matched local/Newton full derivative md5 `a33b5e0b5287bdcaec2fac550a13d5cb`; report md5 `c42b6e5cf8408c0d1cccd5f73b6a319e`. It remains an `algorithmic_code` source, deliberately separate from HumanEval/MBPP completion code. Prefix-order control `686552` failed safely at the standard quality gate with **11 normalized duplicate questions**; its 3k output/report were moved intact under `artifacts/sft/rejected/` and cannot advance. The curator now deduplicates with the same normalized identity as the quality auditor. Fresh admissible shuffled chain **`686583 -> 686584 -> 686585 -> 686586`** selects up to 3k unique rows from 5k seen via a 10k seeded shuffle buffer, replays all supplied tests, freezes a clean `algorithmic_code` candidate (>=1,000 rows), then measures true 2,048-token packing. No SFT may be submitted before those reports are reviewed. |
| **Direct capability audit** | Raw 168k/170k evidence remains negative: raw scored **4/48 Q/A**, **4/48 plain instruction**, **0/48 CoT**, **5/48 one-shot**; the pinned 170k compact-state interview `686370` was **1/8 initial, 0/8 review, 1/8 scaffold, 0/8 compact-state reuse**. A fresh local-MPS seven-case re-interview reproduced **1/7 initial, 0/7 review, 1/7 verified-fact use, 0/7 compact reuse**. A separate eight-case composition interview then independently reproduced **1/8 initial, 0/8 review, 1/8 verified-fact use, 0/8 valid `state=` emissions, and 0/8 valid-state-and-reuse**. Only the simple logic constraint passed; product/reject arithmetic, base conversion, sequential state, sort/string transformation, and two executable Python contracts all failed. New raw-180k visible-thinking interview is **0/12 trace present, 0/12 verified intermediate trace, 0/12 final answer, 0/12 trace-and-final**. It hallucinates `27 x 14 = 498`, compounds it to 7,768, and drops into a fresh `Question:` on base conversion and repair; artifact `thinking_trace_raw180k_mps_20260712.json` is local/Newton md5 `5eb7fa94cea87cc138416801f593f85c`. The fresh typed-state baseline `686456` is similarly negative: **21/420 answers and 0/280 exact emitted states**; by contract it is 0/140 write, 6/140 repair, and 15/140 reuse answers. V5 primitive SFT has a real but narrow direct signal: held-out primitive gate **`686368` = 272/700 (38.86%)** vs raw **0/700**, with 100/100 syllogisms, 88/100 string insertion, 47/100 correction, but only 12/100 arithmetic, 4/100 base conversion, 2/100 sort, and 19/100 state updates. Its verbatim interview `686388` is **2/8 initial, 2/8 review, 1/8 scaffold, 3/8 compact-state reuse**; the new reuse successes are trained primitive-like operations only. Matched matrix `686389` does show Q/A **4/48 -> 17/48** and CoT **0/48 -> 11/48**, concentrated in arithmetic/sort/state, while direct instruction is only **5/48 -> 6/48** and one-shot regresses **7/48 -> 5/48**. Full evidence: `CAPABILITY_DIAGNOSIS.md`, `TARGETS_AND_GAPS.md`, `artifacts/eval_history/deep_interaction_raw170k_r2_686370.json` (md5 `1979bcc79cb18830cb3080a7cab85e82`), refreshed `manual_capability_raw170k_refresh_20260712_mps.json` (md5 `9cd3216365b5292851e298bee4a1aeef`), composition artifact `generalization_interview_raw170k_20260712_mps.json` (md5 `d9ad30fad6c00958ad9d6908ca14c38a`), `sft_v5_primitives_168750_rg_heldout_686368.json` (md5 `4b6fe30e6b75ca7e409a152286f0ff8e`), `sft_v5_primitives_168750_deep_interaction_686388.json` (md5 `19ae7208d981f22abbfe8f9b48523c0c`), and remote state artifact `artifacts/eval_history/raw168750_primitives_v3_state_p20.json`. |
| **Post-board transcript gate** | Fresh operator-run probe `686425` compared raw 168.75k with V5 on seven new cases and preserved every turn. Raw: **1/7 initial, 0/7 review, 1/7 verified-fact, 0/7 state reuse**. V5: **3/7, 3/7, 2/7, 3/7**, limited to arithmetic, sorting, and logic; it still fails base conversion, sequential state update, string insertion, and syntax-valid Python. V5 almost never emitted the requested `state=` line, so its reuse score is **not** latent context compaction. Canonical local/Newton hash-matched artifact: `artifacts/eval_history/manual_capability_raw168750_vs_sft_v5_20260712_JOBID.json`, md5 `28dd0b15de2af16a10a2012f630072a1`. |
| **Visible-thinking decoder correction** | The tokenizer treats `<think>` / `</think>` as special tokens, so default benchmark decoding suppresses them correctly but the first transcript audit hid them. `eval_suite.py` now exposes explicit special-token policy; public boards keep `skip_special_tokens=True`, while trace audits use `False` and strip only sampled EOS. Corrected raw 180k is still **0/12** tags/intermediates/finals/both, now canonically stored at md5 `c13291539297653d92b70cf454f7ee63`; V9's tags **9/12 but 0 correct** remain an explicit format-imitation failure, not thinking. |
| **Verifier selection gate** | Corrected evaluator job `686437` reports held-out GSM8K first-pass **7/100**, oracle@16 **36/100**, verifier@16 **9/100**. Candidate sampling provides real headroom, but the 30-step verifier captures only two points of it. Improve generation and verifier ranking separately; do not report best-of-16 as current pass@1. |
| **Verifier data-volume gate** | The clean first cross-family verifier derivative has 1,201 positive + 1,201 negative examples and only **737 packed 512-token sequences**, or about **92 updates at two epochs**. It is too small and high-variance for a meaningful SFT, so no verifier SFT was submitted. Normalized verifier-prompt dedup now blocks punctuation-only duplicates (`bec11a4`). The 28-family train bank is actually 11,200 rows (400/family). Active isolated H100 rollout `686536` correctly covers its first 10,000 rows/25 sorted families and remains useful, but cannot by itself become training data. New tail rollout **`686564`** skips exactly 10,000 valid rows and covers the missing 1,200/three families; `686565` combines and globally deduplicates both outputs, then `686566` packs the complete 28-family derivative. The prior pending 25-family data/packing jobs `686540`/`686541` were canceled before start. `sft_verifier.sbatch` now refuses to launch unless the packing report is hash-bound to the current JSONL, has both labels, uses the requested length, and reaches **>=3,000 packed 512-token sequences**; that gate is meant to buy several hundred updates rather than repeat the 92-update failure. |
| **Pretraining monitor gate** | `train/eval_nll.py` and isolated `train/jobs/eval_nll.sbatch` report pure token-weighted NLL/perplexity for named frozen monitor JSONLs, excluding any training-only `zloss` and binding every result to an input SHA-256. Fixed English monitor is WikiText-103 test: 1,723 docs / 301,241 source tokens / SHA-256 `fbe8687d618550d2251b397d436abb30a990d5f0b4e7c25cfe85c7265aa251d8`; raw 170k local-MPS baseline is **NLL 3.9648849, PPL 52.7142** over 301,056 tokens (result md5 `fa9f0ea310287d710d9300c8cb0781ab`). Fixed code monitor is CodeContests **test** split: 122 unique Python-3 prompt+code rows / 146,896 source tokens / SHA-256 `62668905552c89650c0dcd79227a6fe606e107c39a126f7c1b5d9364ee8fc687`; raw 170k is **NLL 1.3537146, PPL 3.8718** over 145,408 tokens (result md5 `8b52525e46958ac20a1d6973b6de0cc0`). The gap is useful directional telemetry, but **not a proof of source-disjointness or causality**: the raw code corpus is CodeParrot-Clean and tokenized shards cannot yet prove absence of CodeContests-derived code. Therefore HumanEval/MBPP, held-out execution, and direct code transcripts remain decisive. These are regression monitors, **not** reasoning claims or web-disjointness proofs. H100 attempts `686587`, `686589`, `686590`, and `686592` encountered CUDA-unavailable/busy preflight on evc26/31/36/43 and wrote no result; evaluator now requires a real CUDA tensor allocation before loading a model. Do not burn more H100 slots without a known-good node smoke. Never place monitor inputs in `artifacts/evals` (live decontamination glob) or any training shard path. |
| **Recurrence ablation** | Mame `n_loop=1` job `686301` and `n_loop=2` job `686302` both completed cleanly for 800 matched updates. `n_loop=2` is mechanically stable but not promoted: final logged loss was essentially tied (**2.4890 vs 2.4899**) while time rose **886s -> 1466s** and steady throughput fell **472.7k -> 286.0k tok/s**. New isolated **`686928`** is held after raw board `686861` and loads the immutable 180k checkpoint twice, with `n_loop=1` and `n_loop=2`, for the same 24-case Q/A+CoT matrix and eight-case direct interview. It writes transcripts only, is explicitly an **untrained test-time architecture probe**, and can only decide whether a future equally trained recurrent control is worth running. It cannot promote recurrence or alter the flagship. |
| **Future handoff data stream** | **Fixed forward-only, never applied to active `685084`.** Prior checkpoints did not serialize `ShardLoader` state; every resumed job could recreate its stream from the same `DSEED=777`. The audited `train.py` now records `data_stream_generation`/seed and resumes with a deterministic distinct stream generation. It was synced to Newton at 18:09 EDT while the running Python process remained untouched; a legacy current checkpoint will therefore start successor generation 1 rather than replaying seed 777. Tiny-train smoke verified generation **0 -> 1** and checkpoint metadata. This prevents repeated prefixes at the next natural handoff but does not claim exact cursor restoration for old chunks. |
| Preserved checkpoints (cluster) | Durable milestone anchors include `best_step166250.pt`, `best_step170000.pt`, `best_step180000.pt`, `best_step190000.pt`, `best_step200000.pt`, `best_step252500.pt`, `best_step260000.pt`, `best_step280000.pt`, and **`best_step290000.pt`**. The latest 290k SHA-256 is **`d93128affd1cb83fc3e7034ec045dbb1817be5d2cbbf866ff3b2002ef93e2a31`**. |
| **Local DR backup (Mac)** | Retained local anchors are model-only 60k and **300k**, plus full checkpoints 170k, 200k, 252.5k, 260k, 280k, and 290k. Local 300k is mode 0444 and hash-matched to Newton at SHA-256 **`211d6b2cddf0c2cf8b12cb0b2d73f9c4440d85f6f531018080c8afd35b2f66a6`**. Obsolete copies were removed only after durable anchors were verified. |
| **Large artifact transfer policy** | For big checkpoints/shards/uploads, prefer VPS-to-VPS or Newton-to-VPS staging when credentials/hosts are available; the VPS links have ~20 Gbit internet and should beat Mac↔Newton transfers. Still use `.part` files and md5/sha256 on both ends before trusting or deleting anything. |
| **CPU-only execution policy** | User-directed: route future CPU-only corpus generation, audits, packing, and report jobs to **Stokes** (`ssh sa305415@stokes.ist.ucf.edu`), preserving Newton for H100 work and GPU-adjacent scheduler coordination. Access was revalidated 2026-07-13: Stokes host `euser1` exposes 64 CPUs and the shared `/lustre/fs1/home/sa305415` workspace. Before a launch, verify output ownership and that no writer overlaps an existing Newton job; do not duplicate an in-flight CPU writer. |

**Checkpoints preserved so far:** every 10k through 50k; 60k and 300k are model-only because the trainer
writes terminal `ckpt_final.pt` without optimizer state. Both are local and cluster hash-matched under explicit
numbered/model-only names. The 60k-to-300k extension used fresh optimizer rewarmups and completed cleanly, so
no stale 59k momentum was used. Newton retains the scientifically relevant milestone anchors; the Mac keeps
the compact recovery/comparison set listed above. Any 300k continuation must intentionally use a fresh
optimizer because no 300k optimizer state exists.

**Next actions in order:** (1) Keep the immutable 300k checkpoint and transcript evidence hash-bound; there is no
active flagship writer to babysit. (2) Do not submit the 600k language-balanced continuation until the full 25B
FineWeb replacement and both language-source scan approvals exist and replay successfully. Never substitute the
5B pilots. (3) Keep source-scheduled internalization, DRS, STRR, residual-packet C1/C2, WGRQ v1, R10/R11,
cursor-action v1, final-token readout, exact token-tape v1, additive forked supervision, PCRT, and MCBS closed under
their failed gates. Do not generalize token-tape v1 into a branch-wide no-go. (4) Keep the completed raw-300k
future-Jacobian failure and MCBS observable-quotient no-go closed; do not run coordinate
swaps or train a writer in either subspace. (5) Keep the completed v1 post-commit interface falsifier closed as a
static scorer validation and the `a9c1f53` v2 artifact rejected. Preserve and independently audit the successful
commit-bound v3 artifact/receipt before citing it. V3 authorizes a separate learned architecture preregistration,
not a Shohin fit or reasoning claim. First isolate durable source-deleted state transport with a minimal hard
categorical packet and tied one-event updater against equal-budget favorable controls; only after that gate may a
self-selected operator/address/halting controller be tested. Every future learned candidate must also pass fresh
researcher-written multi-turn interaction with
full transcripts covering state update, source-deleted continuation, review, late-query recoding, and state reuse.
The representation must be frozen before new consumers, update programs, and output recoding are generated. No implementation
may assume the paper's large-model workspace exists at 125.1M parameters. A fresh token-tape v1.1 remains optional representation
localization, not a substitute for a causal update mechanism. Remainder and DONE/EOS remain separate objectives
and may not rescue a failed transition gate. Any controlled future pretrain handoff must use manifest-gated
language, math/reasoning, and code sources; the target is **600k absolute steps**.

## 1a. PROGRESS JOURNAL (append-only — newest last)

Terse, dated entries so a fresh agent sees the trajectory, not just a point-in-time snapshot. **Add a
line at each milestone / intervention / decision.** Don't rewrite history; append.

- **2026-07-06 eve** — Flagship pretrain (job `680149`) running on evc22, single H100, `--steps 60000`,
  domain-interleaved dataloader (the divergence fix). Resumed onto evc22 after earlier cluster-
  saturation churn; stable since.
- **2026-07-06** — Corpus-expansion job `680324` launched on evc1 (CPU) to tokenize finemath-3plus →
  `shards/finemath3` (~25B math tokens, ~doubles corpus + triples math).
- **2026-07-07 ~04:05** — Wrote this runbook + mirrored to cluster + added auto-memory
  `shohin-custody-runbook`. Pretrain ~step 41.3k, loss ~1.6, healthy. User set `/goal`: keep detailed
  docs current for any future agent, and take care of the model overnight.
- **2026-07-07 ~10:25** — Preserved `best_step40000.pt`. Pretrain ~step 47k, still stable-phase.
- **2026-07-07 ~11:00** — **WSD DECAY BEGAN at step 48k** (lr started dropping 0.005→0.0047…). This is
  the phase that converts flat stable-phase loss into capability; 60k will be the first honest read.
- **2026-07-07 ~11:50** — Pretrain ~step 49.3k, loss ~1.6, lr 0.0045, 34 skips total (clean).
  finemath3 at 122 shards (~24.4B), completing imminently. Corrected 60k ETA to ~10–11h (this evening;
  prior "~1.3 days" was an overestimate). Updated §1 + added this journal per user's housekeeping ask.
- **2026-07-07 ~12:06** — **Local disaster-recovery backup taken** (user asked "what's saved locally
  if the cluster dies?"). Local fallback was only step-15k weights; pulled `ckpt_0049000.pt` (1.0 GB,
  full+optimizer, md5 5123710a25e8, verified bit-identical + load-tested) to `train/flagship_out/`.
  Standing habit: refresh the local DR copy at each 10k milestone (overwrite; keep newest 1–2). To
  recover on a fresh machine/cluster: place it in an `--out` dir and launch flagship.sbatch with
  `--resume` (it carries Muon+AdamW state → resumes with momentum). macOS `rsync` rejected fancy flags
  (openrsync); use plain `scp` for cluster→Mac pulls.
- **2026-07-07 ~12:10** — **finemath-3plus corpus DONE** (job 680324 finished). 125 shards, **exactly
  25.0B tokens** (13.41M docs kept of 13.48M; 62.7k dropped short, 8,575 dropped as eval-contaminated),
  22 GB, `shards/finemath3/manifest.json` written. Total pretrain corpus now **62.4B** (37.4B + 25.0B).
  Will fold into SHARDS at the 60k→300k relaunch (§4A b); deliberately NOT added to the current job
  (changing the data mix mid-run — esp. on a recovery resubmit — is unsafe).
- **2026-07-07 ~12:57** — Step 50k reached. Preserved `best_step50000.pt` on cluster; refreshed local
  DR backup → `ckpt_0050000.pt` (md5 53bc952edc0b, verified + load-tested, old 49k removed). Pretrain
  ~step 50.4k, loss ~1.6, lr 0.0041 (decay on track), 34 skips. ~9–10h to 60k.
- **2026-07-07 ~13:50** — Pretrain ~step 51.4k, **loss hit 1.44 (new low)** — decay is converting to
  real loss reduction (lr 0.0037), encouraging pre-60k. Probed OpenMathInstruct-2 for `openmath_pt`
  corpus: fields are `problem` / `generated_solution` / `expected_answer` (need to concat the first
  two). **Blocked on login node** (datasets→torch import fails: OpenBLAS RLIMIT_NPROC thread explosion,
  then `libcupti.so.12` mmap fail) — confirms the standing rule: run tokenization via **sbatch on a
  compute node** (as finemath3 did), never the login node. **Decision: defer `openmath_pt` to
  post-60k** (idle CPU is plentiful during the 2-wk extension; first extend uses the 62B corpus;
  openmath_pt folds in at a later relaunch). To do it: add multi-field concat to `tokenize_shards.py`
  (`--text-cols problem generated_solution`), wrap in a compute-node sbatch, decontam vs evalgrams.
- **2026-07-07 ~14:35** — Pretrain ~step 52.1k, loss ~1.7 (in-band), lr 0.0035, 37 skips (healthy).
  Prep for post-60k `openmath_pt`: added `--text-cols` multi-field-concat flag to
  `pipeline/tokenize_shards.py` (compiles + parses; backward-compatible — default still single
  `--text-col`), synced to cluster (md5 cfa75e03). So post-60k the openmath_pt job is just: wrap
  `tokenize_shards.py --dataset nvidia/OpenMathInstruct-2 --text-cols problem generated_solution
  --decontam-grams evals/evalgrams.pkl --out-dir shards/openmath_pt` in a compute-node sbatch.
- **2026-07-07 ~15:20** — **MAJOR: teacher unlocked + distillation pipeline live.** User revealed a
  free-this-week Hermes/Nous teacher (`hermes` CLI, model `tencent/hy3:free`, Nous Portal, authed on
  the Mac). This unblocks our core thesis (short-CoT distillation — previously GPU-gated). Built
  `pipeline/hermes_distill.py` (rejection-sampled: generate trace → verify vs gold → keep only correct;
  parallel, resumable, emits curated SFT format). Validated: GSM8K **100% yield** (20/20, then 47/48),
  0 rate-limit errors, clean eval-aligned traces. Launched full GSM8K-train distillation in background
  (7,473 problems → `artifacts/sft/hy3_gsm8k.jsonl`). User green-lit ALL FOUR data initiatives — see
  new **§11 DATA EXPANSION PLAN**. Throughput ~0.5/s via CLI (startup-bound); `hermes proxy`
  (OpenAI-compatible) is the scale path for big volume.
- **2026-07-07 ~16:00** — **Breadth expansion (user: "don't just focus on math — all kinds of
  reasoning; use hermes for everything; store data locally").** Generalized `hermes_distill.py` to
  multiple-choice (`mc`) + yes/no (`exact`) verification (per-row `prompt`/`answer_type`). Wrote
  `pipeline/fetch_problems.py` → normalized TRAIN banks in `artifacts/problems/`: gsm8k(7473),
  math(12496), sciq(11679), commonsenseqa(9741), openbookqa(4957), arc_easy(2251), arc_challenge(1119)
  = **~49.7k problems across math + science + commonsense** (logiqa loader deprecated → logic still a
  gap, fill via Reasoning-Gym). `hermes proxy` scale-path abandoned (wants different auth than the CLI
  login). **Machine limit: 8-core / 8 GB Mac** — parallel-process fan-out would OOM, so consolidated to
  **ONE interleaved run** over a shuffled all-domains bank (`combined.jsonl`) at conc 20 (load ~5, mem
  ok) → **`artifacts/sft/hy3_reasoning.jsonl`** (canonical growing file; 92% yield). Resumable; seeded
  with the 474 already-distilled traces. ~0.5/s → banks a few k diverse verified traces over the window.
- **2026-07-07 ~16:30** — **Logic gap filled.** reasoning_gym not installed locally (didn't risk a
  pip install mid-run on the 8 GB Mac); instead fetched **ReClor** (LSAT/GMAT logical reasoning, 4,638
  train, MC) via `datasets` and folded it in. Rebuilt `combined.jsonl` → **54,354 problems / 8 domains**
  (gsm8k, math, sciq, commonsenseqa, openbookqa, arc_easy/challenge, **reclor=logic**). Did a *verified*
  restart of the distiller (PID changed; resumed skipping the 1,703 done; confirmed ALIVE + banking new
  traces before ending the turn). Distillation now spans math + science + commonsense + logic. NOTE:
  harness writes `source="hy3"` for all outputs (per-domain provenance lives in `artifacts/problems/*`;
  map back by question if needed).
- **2026-07-07 ~17:20** — **OpenRouter unlock + faster backend.** User gave an OpenRouter API key
  (stored in git-ignored `.env` as `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — NEVER put it in runbook/memory/mirrored files)
  + two models: `tencent/hy3:free` and `nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b:free` (a 550B teacher, free).
  Added an `--backend openrouter` HTTP path to `hermes_distill.py` (OpenAI-compatible, rate-limit
  backoff) — direct HTTP has no per-call process spawn, so high concurrency is Mac-safe. Also fixed a
  **math verifier bug** (competition-MATH gold carries units/latex like `0.4\mbox{ miles}` that never
  string-matched the model's clean `0.4` → added last-number numeric fallback; yield 16%→87% on easy
  segments). **Switched the bulk run to OpenRouter hy3 conc-24** (`artifacts/sft/hy3_reasoning.jsonl`,
  resumed from ~3,030) — faster + lighter than the CLI. Yield varies by domain (science/gsm8k high;
  competition-math/reclor-logic lower = sampler rejecting hy3's hard-problem misses; kept traces always
  verified). **nemotron-550b** noted for a future *quality* pass on hard math/logic (stronger teacher →
  higher yield on hard problems), but it's slow under concurrency (run low-conc).
- **2026-07-07 ~17:45** — **Multi-provider teacher FLEET** (user: "don't pick one provider — run them
  ALL to max throughput"). Added NVIDIA endpoint (`integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1`) — new models
  `z-ai/glm-5.2` (SoTA, but **currently DEGRADED server-side** — retry later), `nvidia/
  nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b` (strong, concise), `minimaxai/minimax-m3`. Generalized `hermes_distill.py`
  backend to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (`--backend nvidia/openrouter`, `BACKENDS` map, `--max-tokens`
  cap for concise traces). NVIDIA key in git-ignored `.env` (`NVIDIA_API_KEY`). **KEY FINDING: OpenRouter
  free tier = 1,000 requests/DAY** (hit it fast at 2.5/s → 429 `free-models-per-day`; resets ~2.3h) — so
  **OpenRouter is NOT for bulk**; the **hermes CLI (Nous Portal) has no daily cap** and is the reliable
  bulk workhorse. **Current fleet (3 channels, own output files, teacher-diverse):** Nous-hy3 CLI conc-12
  → `hy3_reasoning.jsonl` (bulk); NVIDIA nemotron-ultra conc-6 → `hy3_reasoning_nemotron.jsonl` (80%
  yield); NVIDIA minimax conc-3 → `hy3_reasoning_minimax.jsonl` (was erroring at conc-6, gentled). Merge
  all `hy3_reasoning*.jsonl` for the SFT mix (dedup by question, keep teacher diversity).
- **2026-07-07 ~18:00** — **GLM-5.2 recovered → added as a channel; dropped weak minimax.** GLM-5.2
  (SoTA) is now the best channel: **88% yield @ 1.7/s** (fast + strong, 0 err) → `hy3_reasoning_glm.jsonl`
  (`--backend nvidia --model z-ai/glm-5.2 --concurrency 5`). minimax dropped (25% yield, erroring,
  barely contributing). **Fleet now: Nous-hy3 (bulk) + NVIDIA nemotron-ultra (80%) + NVIDIA GLM-5.2
  (88%, SoTA).** ~4,000 traces total. (minimax file `hy3_reasoning_minimax.jsonl` kept — 49 valid
  traces.) OpenRouter still daily-capped (re-add as burst when reset).
- **2026-07-07 ~18:15** — **GitHub backup (user: "put everything on github as well as locally").**
  Remote = `github.com/GodlyDonuts/shohin`. **Redacted the Newton password** out of this runbook (moved
  to git-ignored `.env` as `NEWTON_PW`); full secret scan clean before pushing. Pushed: all code + docs
  (commit 0aa12b6) + distilled traces + tokenizer + eval sets (commit e487677, ~11M). Deliberately kept
  OUT of git (regenerable, avoid bloat): `openmath2.jsonl` (89M → `sft_curate.py`), problem banks (→
  `fetch_problems.py`). `.env` + `artifacts/` stay git-ignored; specific data files force-added.
  **ONGOING BACKUP HABIT:** periodically (each cycle or two) `git add -f artifacts/sft/hy3_reasoning*.jsonl
  && git add -A && git commit -m "backup: distilled traces + docs" && git push origin main` so the
  growing fleet output + doc updates stay mirrored to GitHub.
- **2026-07-07 ~18:50** — **Claude subagents = 4th teacher channel (user: "make traces with subagents,
  maximize").** Workflow `claude-teacher-distill` (repeatable): I pick fresh UNSOLVED problems, split into
  batches, spawn 20 subagents that each solve their batch (**gold withheld** → genuine reasoning), return
  {id,response}; I verify vs the withheld gold + rejection-sample → `hy3_reasoning_claude.jsonl` (source
  `claude`). First run: 20 agents, 525k tok, 300 problems → 152 kept. **Found + fixed a MATH VERIFIER BUG**
  along the way: competition-MATH gold is LaTeX (`\frac{3}{2}`) which never matched the model's clean
  `3/2` — was silently tanking EVERY teacher's math yield. Fixed `verify()` (LaTeX-aware `_norm_math` +
  `_eval_math` fraction eval); re-verify recovered +87. **Restarted the whole fleet** to pick up the fix
  (they re-attempt previously-rejected problems → recover false-rejected math). Repeatable: to run another
  Claude round, regen `claude_batches.json`+`claude_goldmap.json` (fresh unsolved) then re-invoke the
  workflow scriptPath; verify via `scratchpad/verify_claude.py`. Grand total ~6,225 traces (5 domains,
  4 teachers). WF gotcha: `args` didn't reach the script — hardcode values in the script instead.
- *(next: 60k FEEDBACK+EXTEND (~3.5h) — see §4A; fleet = hy3+nemotron+GLM+Claude-subagents; §11; git push)*
- **2026-07-07 ~19:15** — **Codex takeover.** Verified Newton auth + read-only health: job `680149`
  alive on evc22 at step ~56.9k, lr ~0.0017, 45 skips, latest numbered ckpt `ckpt_0056000.pt`, preserved
  through `best_step50000.pt`; ETA to 60k ~3h. Local teacher fleet still has three open writers:
  `hy3_reasoning.jsonl` (active, PID 33375, ~5.4k rows), `hy3_reasoning_nemotron.jsonl` (PID 33376,
  ~752 rows, slow), and `hy3_reasoning_glm.jsonl` (PID 33377, ~25 rows, process alive but file idle since
  ~18:01; inspect/relaunch only if still idle on next cycle). Created Codex heartbeat
  `shohin-flagship-custody` every ~40 min for the 60k transition. Do not manually edit live JSONL files.
- **2026-07-07 ~19:50** — **SFT data policy upgraded.** User made Codex executive director. Decision:
  default SFT should train from a frozen, auditable curated mix, not live distiller files and not the
  old math-only baseline. Added `pipeline/build_sft_mix.py`; `train/jobs/sft.sbatch` now builds
  `artifacts/sft/sft_mix_core.jsonl` by default (deduped by normalized question, concise response caps,
  source-priority tie-breaks) and keeps `SFT_BASELINE=1` as the old `openmath2 + rgym + code` escape
  hatch. Pulled missing `rgym.jsonl` from Newton to local. Local snapshot: **81,894 examples** =
  OpenMath backbone + 993 Reasoning-Gym + 446 code + ~6.2k verified teacher traces. Before 60k SFT,
  sync current local `hy3_reasoning*.jsonl` and this new script/job to Newton, then let `sft.sbatch`
  build the cluster-side frozen mix.
- **2026-07-07 ~22:15-22:35** — **60k FEEDBACK+EXTEND transition executed.** Job `680149` finished cleanly:
  `[done] 60000 steps in 112203s`, 45 skips total, final logged loss band still healthy. Trainer only
  wrote model-only `ckpt_final.pt`, so created `best_step60000.model.pt` and numbered
  `ckpt_0060000.pt` from final weights; extension uses `FRESH_OPT=1` to rewarm optimizer instead of
  carrying stale 59k momentum. Synced latest teacher traces to Newton and rebuilt cluster
  `sft_mix_core.jsonl` (**85,593 examples**). First SFT submission `680991` exposed a cwd bug: `sft.sbatch`
  rebuilt the mix from `$BASE/train` and produced 0 rows. Canceled it immediately, fixed script to build
  from repo root, rebuilt mix, and relaunched SFT as **`681000`** on evc43. Launched 300k extension as
  **`680992`** on evc22 with SHARDS including `finemath3`; verified resume line:
  `ckpt_0060000.pt -> start step 60001 (FRESH optimizer: momentum reset + rewarmup)`.
- **2026-07-07 ~23:15** — **Local checkpoint custody verified.** Downloaded and hash-matched Newton to
  Mac: `ckpt_0060000.pt` / `best_step60000.model.pt` (model-only 60k, md5
  `d2fdf867bd49cf517b62364e152bffde`), `ckpt_0059000.pt` (full+optimizer fallback, md5
  `0038df81be145cf4a4b0644e2dce284a`), and `sft_ep3.pt` (md5
  `dda39ab36aa73bd6284b94d9fbf252e5`). SFT job `681000` completed; eval job **`681030`** is running on
  evc32 against `sft_ep3.pt`. Extension job `680992` healthy at step ~60.8k, loss in band, rewarmup lr
  ~0.002, throughput ~147k tok/s. Next DR target: download 70k checkpoint when it appears.
- **2026-07-07 ~23:20** — Heartbeat check: extension job `680992` healthy at step **60,920** (loss
  1.7179, lr 0.0023, ~147.6k tok/s); eval job `681030` still running, partial board currently shows
  `sft_ep3.pt` weak on early math metrics (GSM8K 6/100, MATH500 0/100; code still in progress). Local
  distillers: HY3 process alive but not recently writing, nemotron still slowly adding rows, GLM had no
  data movement since 22:41 and no log movement since 18:58. Terminated the stalled GLM PID and probed
  NVIDIA directly; `z-ai/glm-5.2` returned HTTP 429, so do **not** relaunch GLM until a later heartbeat
  shows the provider limit cleared. HY3 and nemotron were left untouched.
- **2026-07-07 ~23:27** — User challenged whether 2 GPUs are worth the speedup. Decision: yes, likely
  worth pursuing, but only through a measured canary that preserves training semantics. Added
  `train/jobs/ddp2_canary.sbatch` and submitted **job `681040`** as a separate 2-H100 branch, excluding
  the live/eval/down nodes. It copies `flagship_out/ckpt_0060000.pt` into its own output directory
  (`train/ddp2_canary_60000_20260707_232737`) and runs `NG=2 BS=16 ACC=8 STEPS=61050 FRESH_OPT=1`
  with the same 62.4B shard mix and same effective batch as the single-GPU extension. **Do not kill or
  migrate `680992` yet.** Promotion rule: only switch the flagship to two GPUs after `681040` shows clean
  DDP startup, no rank hang, loss/skip behavior matching the 60k replay, and materially better throughput
  (target at least ~1.6x useful tok/s).
- **2026-07-08 ~00:00** — Heartbeat milestone: `sft_ep3.pt` eval job `681030` completed cleanly in
  48m41s but the recipe underperformed badly on the small board: GSM8K **6/100**, MATH500 **0/100**,
  HumanEval **4/164**, MBPP **0/100**. Treat this as evidence that the first curated SFT format/mixture
  is not yet useful, not as a pretrain failure; live pretrain remains healthy at step **61,620** (loss
  1.5953, lr 0.0040, ~148.7k tok/s). Downloaded and hash-verified `ckpt_0061000.pt` to the Mac
  (full+optimizer, md5 `28a18ebd7efc67cbbb72db6505493248`) as the latest post-60k DR point. Canary
  `681040` is still pending on priority with scheduled node `evc42` and predicted start around
  2026-07-08 01:01. HY3/nemotron teacher writers are still producing valid JSONL; GLM remains paused
  on NVIDIA 429.
- **2026-07-08 ~00:06** — User clarified transfer ops: large uploads/downloads should use VPS-to-VPS
  or Newton-to-VPS staging when possible because those links have ~20 Gbit internet. Updated the live
  transfer policy accordingly. Mac local DR copies are still useful, but for bulk checkpoint/corpus
  movement the preferred path is via VPS staging with `.part` files plus md5/sha256 verification on both
  ends.
- **2026-07-08 ~00:55** — **2-H100 canary succeeded; promotion attempted with safe fallback.** Canary
  job `681040` completed cleanly on evc42: `world=2`, resumed from `ckpt_0060000.pt`, no DDP hang, loss
  stayed in band, and throughput reached ~262k tok/s vs the live 1-GPU ~149k tok/s (~1.76x). Preserved
  the live full checkpoint `ckpt_0062000.pt` to `best_step62000_pre2gpu.pt` (md5
  `e4f3de659effac5c6875c6ae17d6b544`) and stopped old 1-GPU job `680992`. A direct long 2-GPU promotion
  did not start promptly due Slurm priority, so switched to short backfill chunks: current job `681083`
  is RUNNING on evc32 for 30m, resumed from `ckpt_0062000.pt`, and has printed steps through 62030.
  Queue is dependency-ordered to avoid overlapping writes to `flagship_out`: `681080` 1-GPU 2h starts
  after `681083`; `681078` 2-GPU 2h starts after `681080` using new `train/jobs/flagship2.sbatch`.
- **2026-07-08 ~01:25** — **Backfill handoff guarded.** Short 1-GPU job `681083` ran to its 30-minute
  limit on evc32, resumed from `ckpt_0062000.pt`, reached step **62490**, and last saved
  `ckpt_0062400.pt`; loss stayed in band. `681080` was released but priority-pending with predicted
  start ~02:35 on evc50, so submitted deadline-bounded filler **`681087`** (`--time=00:30:00`,
  `--deadline=02:30`, `CKPT=100`) and set `681080` dependency to `afterany:681087`. This prevents
  overlapping writes while allowing Slurm to use any short backfill hole before the scheduled
  continuation.
- **2026-07-08 ~01:27** — Filler `681087` started immediately on evc32, resumed from
  `ckpt_0062400.pt -> start step 62401`, and printed healthy early steps through **62430** (loss
  1.65-1.69, lr 0.0050). `681080` remains held on `afterany:681087`; next check must ensure it releases
  after the filler ends and resumes from the newest checkpoint.
- **2026-07-08 ~01:59** — **Handoff to scheduled continuation succeeded.** Filler `681087` timed out
  cleanly at 30m after reaching **step 62900** and saving `ckpt_0062900.pt`. Scheduled 1-GPU job
  **`681080`** started immediately on evc29, resumed from `ckpt_0062900.pt -> start step 62901`, and
  printed healthy steps through **62940** (loss 1.60-1.66, lr 0.0050). Next queued job remains
  **`681078`**, the 2-H100 chunk, dependency-held behind `681080` to avoid concurrent writes.
- **2026-07-08 ~02:20** — **2-GPU promotion tightened after user sleep handoff.** User pointed at idle
  `ev6`/`ev16` and `evc105`. Verified `evc6`/`evc16` are idle but are V100 nodes
  (`tesla_v100-pcie-16gb:2` and `tesla_v100-pcie-32gb:2`), unsafe/likely slower for this bf16 H100
  trainer. Verified `evc105` is idle 4x H200 NVL but only in `short,ucfit`; `sbatch --test-only` on
  both partitions returns `Invalid account or account/partition combination`, so this account cannot use
  it. No normal-partition node currently has 2 free H100s; `681080` is still healthy on one H100 (latest
  seen **step 63190**, `ckpt_0063000.pt` saved), so do not kill it. Updated `flagship2.sbatch` to the
  lean request (`-c 4`, `--mem=96G`, `OMP_NUM_THREADS=2`) and replaced old queued `681078` with
  **`681090`**, a dependency-held 2-H100 job after `681080` with `NG=2 BS=16 ACC=8`, `CKPT=500`, and
  only down/drain H100 nodes excluded.
- **2026-07-08 ~02:23** — **Overnight no-idle chain installed.** User is asleep and asked Codex to act
  as executive director, try hard for 2 GPUs, and benchmark/verify as needed. Patched `flagship2.sbatch`
  with `AUTO_REQUEUE` control to avoid a fallback overlap if a 2-GPU zero-step failure self-requeues.
  Replaced `681090` with **`681091`**, a lean 2-H100 job after `681080` with `AUTO_REQUEUE=0` and
  deadline `2026-07-08T06:20:00` (2h job must start by ~04:20, shortly after `681080` ends). Queued
  **`681092`** as the 1-H100 fallback `afterany:681091`. Outcome: if Slurm can place 2 H100s, 681091
  runs; if not, deadline cancellation releases 681092 so training keeps moving with a single writer.
- **2026-07-08 ~02:36** — Heartbeat: `681080` remains RUNNING on evc29, healthy through **step 63570**,
  with `ckpt_0063500.pt` saved and throughput ~142k tok/s. Saw two isolated `[skip:gnorm]` events around
  step 63340, then immediate recovery to normal gnorm/loss; no intervention. `681091` (2-H100) and
  `681092` (1-H100 fallback) remain dependency-held. Local HY3/Nemotron teacher writers are alive and
  valid JSONL (`hy3_reasoning` ~18.5k rows, `nemotron` ~1.18k rows).
- **2026-07-08 ~03:16** — Heartbeat: `681080` remains RUNNING on evc29, healthy through **step 64240**,
  with `ckpt_0064000.pt` saved and throughput ~144.6k tok/s. A single additional isolated gnorm skip
  occurred around step 63699 and recovered immediately. `681091` (lean 2-H100 attempt) and `681092`
  (1-H100 fallback) are still dependency-held behind `681080`. Local HY3/Nemotron teacher writers are
  alive and valid JSONL (`hy3_reasoning` ~19.7k rows, `nemotron` ~1.22k rows).
- **2026-07-08 ~04:05** — **2-H100 continuation live.** `681080` timed out cleanly on evc29 after
  reaching **step 64890**; last saved checkpoint was `ckpt_0064500.pt`, so expected unsaved tail was
  discarded. `681091` started immediately on evc42 with two H100s visible, `world=2`, `NG=2 BS=16
  ACC=8`, and resumed from `ckpt_0064500.pt -> start step 64501`. Healthy early steps through
  **64680**; throughput is warming past **238k tok/s** and should continue toward the canary's ~260k.
  Canceled old 1-H100 fallback `681092` and queued **`681105`** as the next 2-H100 chunk after `681091`
  (deadline `2026-07-08T08:20:00`, `AUTO_REQUEUE=0`), with **`681106`** as the 1-H100 fallback after
  `681105`. This keeps the run on the fastest validated path while preserving single-writer safety.
- **2026-07-08 ~04:42** — **2-H100 continuation steady-state verified.** `681091` is still RUNNING on
  evc42 with `world=2`, healthy through **step 65860**, loss/gnorm in band, and throughput now
  **~269.6k tok/s**, slightly above the canary target. Checkpoints **`ckpt_0065000.pt`** and
  **`ckpt_0065500.pt`** are saved; pulled `ckpt_0065500.pt` to the Mac and md5-verified it
  (`670ae99c278cf26706ebb1b5ee8d7b72`) as the first stable promoted 2-H100 DR point. Queue remains
  single-writer safe: `681105` is dependency-held after `681091`; `681106` is the 1-H100 fallback after
  `681105`. HY3/Nemotron local teacher writers remain alive and valid JSONL (~22.4k HY3, ~1.31k
  Nemotron).
- **2026-07-08 ~05:59** — **2-H100 handoff succeeded.** `681091` hit wall-time on evc42 at 05:55,
  after reaching **step 68190** and saving **`ckpt_0068000.pt`** (latest durable point from that chunk).
  `681105` started immediately on evc29 with two H100s, `world=2`, `NG=2 BS=16 ACC=8`, and resumed from
  **`ckpt_0068000.pt -> start step 68001`**. First printed step **68010** is healthy; throughput is
  still cold-starting/compiling. `681106` remains dependency-held as the 1-H100 fallback after `681105`.
  Local HY3/Nemotron teacher writers remain alive and valid JSONL (~25.0k HY3, ~1.39k Nemotron).
- **2026-07-08 ~06:40** — **681105 healthy; next 2-H100 chunk queued.** `681105` is healthy through
  **step 69440** on evc29, still `world=2`, loss/gnorm in band, and throughput has warmed to **~268.8k
  tok/s**. Checkpoints **`ckpt_0068500.pt`** and **`ckpt_0069000.pt`** are saved. Submitted **`681115`**
  as the next 2-H100 chunk after `681105` with deadline `2026-07-08T10:20:00`, `AUTO_REQUEUE=0`,
  `NG=2 BS=16 ACC=8`, `CKPT=500`, and the same explicit bad/down-node exclusion; moved **`681106`**
  behind `681115` as the 1-H100 fallback. HY3 bulk distiller was not alive; `conc=2` and `conc=1`
  restarts both exited without appending, although direct Hermes and a tiny foreground probe completed
  cleanly. Decision: leave HY3 paused until the harness is inspected instead of churn-restarting it.
  Nemotron remains alive and writing. Next heartbeat: preserve 70k when available and verify `681115`
  remains dependency-held or starts cleanly after `681105`.
- **2026-07-08 ~07:20** — **70k preserved and locally verified.** `681105` is still RUNNING on evc29,
  healthy through **step 70600**, `world=2`, loss/gnorm in band, throughput **~272.6k tok/s**. Preserved
  Newton `ckpt_0070000.pt` to **`best_step70000.pt`** and verified both md5
  `87f28ff961c579c7263136892b340d6f`; downloaded `ckpt_0070000.pt` to the Mac via `.part` and md5
  matched it as the latest local DR checkpoint. `ckpt_0070500.pt` also exists on Newton. Queue remains
  single-writer safe: `681115` dependency-held after `681105`, `681106` fallback after `681115`.
- **2026-07-08 ~08:05** — **2-H100 handoff to `681115` succeeded; next block queued.** `681105` timed
  out cleanly on evc29 after reaching **step 71730** and saving **`ckpt_0071500.pt`**. `681115` started
  immediately on evc29 with two H100s, `world=2`, `NG=2 BS=16 ACC=8`, and resumed from
  **`ckpt_0071500.pt -> start step 71501`**; early steps through **71590** are healthy, with throughput
  warming through **~209.7k tok/s** after compile. Submitted **`681123`** as the next 2-H100 chunk after
  `681115` (deadline `2026-07-08T12:20:00`, `AUTO_REQUEUE=0`) and moved **`681106`** behind it as the
  1-H100 fallback. Local HY3 remains paused at 25,243 rows pending harness inspection; Nemotron remains
  alive and writing (`hy3_reasoning_nemotron.jsonl` 1,510 rows).
- **2026-07-08 ~08:40** — **681115 steady-state verified.** `681115` is still RUNNING on evc29 with
  `world=2`, healthy through **step 72750**, **0 skips**, loss/gnorm in band, and throughput warmed to
  **~271.9k tok/s**. Checkpoints **`ckpt_0072000.pt`** and **`ckpt_0072500.pt`** are saved. Queue remains
  single-writer safe: **`681123`** waits on `afterany:681115`; **`681106`** waits on `afterany:681123`
  as the 1-H100 fallback. Nemotron teacher remains alive and writing (`hy3_reasoning_nemotron.jsonl`
  1,552 rows); HY3 remains paused pending harness inspection.
- **2026-07-08 ~09:20** — **681115 remains fast; second 2-H100 follow-on queued.** `681115` is RUNNING
  on evc29, healthy through **step 74030**, loss/gnorm in band, throughput **~274.6k tok/s**. There was
  one isolated gnorm skip at **step 73008** (`gnorm 3.25` vs EMA `0.11`) with immediate recovery; no
  action needed. Checkpoints **`ckpt_0073000.pt`**, **`ckpt_0073500.pt`**, and **`ckpt_0074000.pt`** are
  saved. Submitted **`681131`** as the next 2-H100 chunk after `681123` (deadline
  `2026-07-08T14:20:00`, same `NG=2 BS=16 ACC=8`, `CKPT=500`, `AUTO_REQUEUE=0`, bad/down-node exclude)
  and moved **`681106`** behind `681131` as the 1-H100 fallback. Nemotron remains alive and writing
  (`hy3_reasoning_nemotron.jsonl` 1,596 rows).
- **2026-07-08 ~09:50** — **GLM teacher status clarified.** GLM was not dropped for quality; it is
  paused because both available paths are currently blocked. Raw NVIDIA `z-ai/glm-5.2` still returns
  HTTP 429. A bounded OpenRouter GLM-5.2 attempt (`limit=300`, `concurrency=2`) was tested, but
  OpenRouter returned a key total-limit HTTP 403 and appended no rows. Keep GLM as the top-priority
  teacher to relaunch when quota/credits/provider access clears; do not treat Nemotron as a stronger
  replacement, only as the currently available strong channel.
- **2026-07-08 ~10:05** — **2-H100 handoff to `681123` succeeded; third follow-on queued.** `681115`
  timed out cleanly on evc29 after reaching **step 75230** and saving **`ckpt_0075000.pt`**. `681123`
  started immediately on evc29 with two H100s, `world=2`, `NG=2 BS=16 ACC=8`, and resumed from
  **`ckpt_0075000.pt -> start step 75001`**; first printed step **75010** is healthy, with startup
  throughput still cold after compile and **0 skips**. Submitted **`681136`** as the next 2-H100 chunk
  after `681131` (deadline `2026-07-08T16:20:00`, same `NG=2 BS=16 ACC=8`, `CKPT=500`,
  `AUTO_REQUEUE=0`, bad/down-node exclude) and moved **`681106`** behind `681136` as the 1-H100
  fallback. Nemotron remains alive and writing (`hy3_reasoning_nemotron.jsonl` 1,643 rows).
- **2026-07-08 ~11:05** — **681123 steady-state verified; fourth follow-on queued.** `681123` is RUNNING
  on evc29 with `world=2`, healthy through **step 76950**, loss/gnorm in band, throughput warmed to
  **~272.2k tok/s**. One isolated gnorm skip occurred at **step 76508** (`gnorm 3.17` vs EMA `0.11`) and
  recovered immediately; no intervention. Checkpoints **`ckpt_0075500.pt`**, **`ckpt_0076000.pt`**, and
  **`ckpt_0076500.pt`** are saved. Submitted **`681188`** as the next 2-H100 chunk after `681136`
  (deadline `2026-07-08T18:20:00`, same `NG=2 BS=16 ACC=8`, `CKPT=500`, `AUTO_REQUEUE=0`,
  bad/down-node exclude) and moved **`681106`** behind `681188` as the 1-H100 fallback. Nemotron remains
  alive and writing (`hy3_reasoning_nemotron.jsonl` 1,682 rows).
- **2026-07-08 ~11:20** — **681123 still healthy; fifth follow-on queued.** `681123` remains RUNNING
  on evc29 with `world=2`, healthy through **step 77510**, loss/gnorm in band, throughput **~273.2k
  tok/s**, and still only the one isolated gnorm skip at step 76508. Checkpoints **`ckpt_0077000.pt`**
  and **`ckpt_0077500.pt`** are saved. Scheduler `--test-only` accepted another 2-H100 continuation, so
  submitted **`681193`** after `681188` (deadline `2026-07-08T20:20:00`, same `NG=2 BS=16 ACC=8`,
  `CKPT=500`, `AUTO_REQUEUE=0`, bad/down-node exclude) and moved **`681106`** behind `681193` as the
  1-H100 fallback. Nemotron remains alive and writing (`hy3_reasoning_nemotron.jsonl` 1,710 rows).
- **2026-07-08 ~11:50** — **SFT mix audit found and fixed a contamination gap.** The pretraining
  manifests already show evalgram drops for all active shard dirs (`finemath4`, `openwebmath`,
  `code_python`, `finemath3`), so live pretraining data is decontam-gated. The frozen SFT mix, however,
  lacked a hard eval-overlap gate and local audit found exact Math500 prompt collisions. Patched
  `pipeline/build_sft_mix.py` to drop exact eval prompt hashes by default and to drop question+response
  13-gram hits when `artifacts/evals/evalgrams.pkl` is present. Rebuilt evalgrams locally and rebuilt
  the Newton SFT mix: **97,439 examples**, **0 exact eval prompt hits**, 0 malformed rows, 0 duplicate
  questions; dropped **206 exact eval-prompt overlaps** and **741 eval 13-gram overlaps**. Frozen mix md5
  `53ed91368b4c238dc18a1ab1699e4158`; report md5 `21459b382767801e205f3f625ce106cd`. Treat this as the
  minimum quality bar for any future SFT variant.
- **2026-07-08 ~12:05** — **681123 timed out cleanly; downstream queue repaired.** `681123` reached
  **step 78700**, saved **`ckpt_0078500.pt`**, then hit wall-time. `681131` is pending resources on evc32
  with a scheduled start around 14:27 EDT but still has its old 14:20 deadline; Slurm denied deadline
  edits. To avoid stale/failing downstream dependencies, canceled old follow-ons `681136`/`681188`/
  `681193` and submitted fresh 2-H100 jobs **`681241` -> `681242` -> `681243`** behind `681131` with
  realistic deadlines. Moved `681106` behind `681243` as the 1-H100 fallback. Next custody check must
  verify whether `681131` starts or cancels, then confirm the first running successor resumes from
  `ckpt_0078500.pt`.
- **2026-07-08 ~12:16** — **Canceled stale `681131` blocker.** `681131` was still pending resources with
  a scheduled start after its deadline, so it could only delay the replacement chain. Fresh `sbatch
  --test-only` probes showed both 1-H100 and 2-H100 no earlier than ~14:39, so there was no reason to
  abandon the faster 2-H100 path. Canceled `681131`; **`681241`** is now the next active candidate,
  pending resources with `squeue --start` estimating **2026-07-08T14:27:41**. `681242`/`681243`/`681106`
  remain correctly chained behind it. Nemotron remains alive and writing (`hy3_reasoning_nemotron.jsonl`
  1,755 rows).
- **2026-07-08 ~13:05** — **Normal-priority wait; DR checkpoint preserved; Nemotron relaunched.** The
  scheduler moved the 2-H100 chain out to **2026-07-09T06:28** because of fairshare/priority, and actual
  submitted jobs did not get the earlier backfill reservations that `sbatch --test-only` briefly
  predicted. Tried 2-H100, 1-H100, 30m, 20m, and 1h shapes; current queue is **`681308` -> `681309` ->
  `681310`** (1-hour 2-H100 chunks, `CKPT=250`) then **`681311`** 1-H100 fallback. `short`, `ucfit`, and
  `highgpu` still reject this account, so there is no expanded-compute escape yet. Pulled
  **`ckpt_0078500.pt`** to the Mac via `.part`; local md5 matches Newton:
  `72b5531043e16e7c1cc1697577036e69`. Nemotron old PID had died at 1,762 rows; foreground probe worked,
  so relaunched it in detached `screen` session **`shohin_nemotron`** at concurrency 2 with log
  `scratchpad/nemotron_screen.log`.
- **2026-07-08 ~14:25** — **Queue estimate improved, but teacher providers are unhealthy.** `681308`
  remains the next valid single-writer training job, but `squeue --start` improved from tomorrow morning
  to **2026-07-08T22:28:00**. A fresh same-shape candidate (`681360`) did not receive the earlier
  `sbatch --test-only` reservation and was canceled, leaving only the intended `681308 -> 681309 ->
  681310 -> 681311` chain. Nemotron `screen` completed with many provider errors but added rows to
  **1,781**; bounded follow-up probes showed Nemotron `limit=5` kept 0 with 3 errors, and GLM `limit=3`
  kept 0 with 3 errors. Leave Nemotron/GLM paused until provider health clears; do not burn requests in
  error loops.
- **2026-07-08 ~14:45** — **Training resumed + recurring benchmark track installed.** `681308` started
  on **evc32**, resumed from `ckpt_0078500.pt` at step 78501 with `world=2`, saved `ckpt_0078750.pt`,
  and was healthy through step **78870** with throughput warming through ~239k tok/s. Patched and synced
  `train/jobs/eval_all.sbatch` so every board writes a normal log plus structured metric rows to
  `artifacts/eval_history/metrics.jsonl`. Queued low-priority progress benchmark **`681373`** after
  `681310`, targeting `ckpt_0080000.pt` (`RUN_TAG=pretrain_080000_progress`, `N=100`, `K=4`). Benchmark
  doctrine: use a separate H100 when capacity allows, but never let eval displace live pretraining.
- **2026-07-08 ~15:35** — **80k gate preserved and handoff verified.** `681308` reached step **80280**
  before wall-time and saved `ckpt_0080250.pt`; `ckpt_0080000.pt` was copied to `best_step80000.pt` on
  Newton and downloaded to the Mac with matching md5 **`ebe28d10d26f78bf3e3395ff64f9ce92`**. Successor
  **`681309`** started immediately on **evc32**, resumed from `ckpt_0080250.pt -> step 80251`, confirmed
  `world=2`, and printed first healthy step 80260. Local teacher snapshots unchanged since provider
  pause: HY3 25,243; Claude 152; GLM 29; minimax 51; Nemotron 1,781; all valid JSONL, no active local
  distiller processes.
- **2026-07-08 ~16:35** — **82k handoff verified.** `681309` ran cleanly through step **82090**, saved
  `ckpt_0082000.pt`, and timed out at wall-time. Throughput reached ~275k tok/s; one isolated gnorm
  bump at step 81890 recovered immediately. Successor **`681310`** started immediately on **evc32**,
  resumed from `ckpt_0082000.pt -> step 82001`, confirmed `world=2`, and printed first healthy step
  82010. Queue now has `681311` as the 1-H100 fallback and low-priority eval `681373` after `681310`;
  decide whether to add another 2-H100 chunk before `681310` ends, preserving single-writer safety.
- **2026-07-08 ~17:35** — **83.75k handoff to 1-H100 fallback verified.** `681310` ran cleanly through
  step **83850**, saved **`ckpt_0083750.pt`**, and timed out at wall-time. Throughput stayed ~274-275k
  tok/s; one gnorm skip at step 83508 recovered immediately. `681311` started immediately on **evc32**,
  resumed from `ckpt_0083750.pt -> step 83751`, confirmed `world=1 bs=16 accum=16`, and printed healthy
  startup steps through 83780. Independent 1-H100 and 2-H100 probes both estimated 2026-07-08T23:18,
  so do not block tokens waiting for 2-H100. A mistaken successor `683714` lacking explicit 300k
  exports was canceled and replaced by **`683715`** afterany:`681311` with `STEPS=300000`,
  `LRMUON=0.005`, `LRADAM=1e-3`, `DSEED=777`, `CKPT=250`, `AUTO_REQUEUE=0`. Eval `681373` is still
  low-priority and estimated 2026-07-09T11:43.
- **2026-07-08 ~18:58** — **85k checkpoint healthy on fallback.** `681311` is still running on **evc32**
  and has progressed cleanly through **step 85200** with throughput ~148k tok/s, loss/gnorm in band, and
  no skips in the current tail. Saved `ckpt_0084000.pt`, `ckpt_0084500.pt`, and **`ckpt_0085000.pt`**.
  Fresh after-`681311` scheduler probes estimate 1-H100 around **2026-07-09T02:56** and 2-H100 around
  **2026-07-09T05:56**, so keep the existing 1-H100 successor **`683715`** unless a later probe shows an
  earlier safe 2-H100 slot. Eval `681373` remains low-priority with estimate 2026-07-09T10:39; teacher
  distillers remain paused, with HY3 25,243 / Claude 152 / GLM 29 / minimax 51 / Nemotron 1,781 valid
  local rows.
- **2026-07-08 ~19:40** — **Fallback window ended cleanly; waiting for earliest safe restart.** `681311`
  reached **step 85780** on **evc32**, saved latest durable **`ckpt_0085500.pt`**, and then hit the
  expected wall-time limit at 19:30 EDT. No divergence signal: throughput ~148.8k tok/s and loss/gnorm
  stayed in band. Current queue has no active trainer; **`683715`** is pending priority with estimated
  start **2026-07-08T22:46:08**. Verified only whitelisted Slurm env values: `STEPS=300000`,
  `LRMUON=0.005`, `LRADAM=1e-3`, `DSEED=777`, `CKPT=250`, `AUTO_REQUEUE=0`; missing `NG/BS/ACC` is OK
  because the batch script defaults are the intended 1-H100 `1/16/16`. Fresh 30m/1h/2h 1-H100 probes
  and a 2-H100 probe all start later than `683715`, so leave it as the restart path.
- **2026-07-08 ~20:58** — **Restart verified early.** `683715` started earlier than its prior estimate,
  running on **evc43** at 20:28 EDT. Verified config: `[model] ... world=1 bs=16 accum=16`, resume line
  **`ckpt_0085500.pt -> start step 85501`**. This replays the unsaved 85501-85780 tail from `681311`,
  which is expected because `ckpt_0085500.pt` was the latest durable checkpoint. `683715` has already
  saved **`ckpt_0085750.pt`** and is healthy through **step 85920** with loss/gnorm in band and throughput
  warming through ~141k tok/s. Eval `681373` is still low-priority, now estimated 2026-07-09T07:30.
- **2026-07-08 ~22:20** — **Training steady; 80k benchmark repaired and rerun.** `683715` is healthy
  through **step 87270**, throughput ~146k tok/s, loss/gnorm in band, with checkpoints through
  **`ckpt_0087250.pt`** saved. Low-priority eval `681373` ran on evc35 but failed immediately because
  `TARGET_STEP=80000` resolved to missing `ckpt_0080000.pt`; the preserved file is
  **`best_step80000.pt`**. Patched `train/jobs/eval_all.sbatch` so `TARGET_STEP` falls back to
  `best_step${TARGET_STEP}.pt` when the numbered checkpoint is absent, synced the script to Newton, and
  submitted replacement low-priority eval **`683820`**. Verified it started on **evc35** against
  `best_step80000.pt` with `RUN_TAG=pretrain_080000_progress`, `N=100`, `K=4`; training continues on
  evc43, so eval is not displacing the trainer.
- **2026-07-08 ~23:40** — **80k progress benchmark completed; training steady.** `683820` completed
  cleanly on evc35 in 59m18s and appended 5 rows to `artifacts/eval_history/metrics.jsonl`.
  `best_step80000.pt` scored: GSM8K maj@4 **0/100**, GSM8K pass@1 **3/100**, MATH500 **2/100**,
  HumanEval **5/164**, MBPP **0/100**. Interpretation: raw pretrain is not yet showing broad benchmark
  lift versus the weak SFT board; MATH and HumanEval ticked up, GSM8K did not. Keep training; the next
  meaningful check should be a later checkpoint and/or a better SFT variant. `683715` remains healthy
  through **step 88630**, saved **`ckpt_0088500.pt`**, throughput ~147k tok/s. One isolated gnorm skip at
  step 87819 recovered immediately.
- **2026-07-09 ~01:05** — **90k checkpoint preserved and locally verified.** `683715` remains RUNNING
  on **evc43**, saved **`ckpt_0090000.pt`**, and continued healthy through **step 90060** at ~147.4k
  tok/s. Copied the Newton checkpoint to **`best_step90000.pt`** and verified matching md5
  `6080e105dc0bacfd607efeeefa1253dd`; downloaded `train/flagship_out/ckpt_0090000.pt` to the Mac via
  `.part` and verified the same md5 locally. Recent skips at 89047 and 89409-89410 recovered immediately.
  The local git index is still being touched by an external `git add`/`hash-object` process over large
  artifacts, so this runbook update is synced to Newton but GitHub push should wait until the index is
  safe.
- **2026-07-09 ~11:00** — **100k checkpoint preserved and locally verified.** `683715` remains RUNNING
  on **evc43**, saved **`ckpt_0100000.pt`**, and continued healthy past **step 100170** at ~148.0k
  tok/s with live H100 utilization ~99-100%. Copied the Newton checkpoint to **`best_step100000.pt`**
  and verified matching md5 `d8ebd43d0c13c32aa221832bfc09202b`; downloaded
  `train/flagship_out/ckpt_0100000.pt` to the Mac via `.part` and verified the same md5 locally. Added
  `train/jobs/microbatch_canary.sbatch`, an isolated side branch from `ckpt_0100000.pt` with
  `BS=32 ACC=8` (same 524,288 tokens/update as live `BS=16 ACC=16`) to test whether larger per-GPU
  microbatches improve single-H100 throughput before touching the live run. Slurm dry-run placed it on
  a separate node and real submission **`683939`** ran on **evc22** with `--exclude=evc43`, so it did not
  contend with the live trainer node. Result: completed cleanly in **20m28s**, `BS=32` fit at ~64 GB
  VRAM, and recent-window throughput was **~154.5k tok/s** versus live **~148.0k tok/s** (~+4%). Because
  the initial bounded canary used its short `STEPS=100300` as the LR schedule length, treat it as a
  throughput/memory measurement only; patched `train.py` with `--lr-total-steps` and updated
  `microbatch_canary.sbatch` so future short canaries can keep the 300k LR schedule. Decision: keep the
  current healthy live run; consider `BS=32 ACC=8` at the next natural restart/handoff, not by killing a
  stable allocation mid-window.
- **2026-07-09 ~14:17** — `683715` remains healthy on **evc43** at **step 103580**, holding
  **~148.09k tok/s** with checkpoint cadence intact through `ckpt_0103500.pt`. One gnorm skip at
  **103322** recovered immediately. To answer the VRAM-efficiency question with measurement rather
  than inference, submitted isolated canary **`684000`** (`BS=64 ACC=4`, same 524,288 tokens/update,
  corrected `--lr-total-steps 300000`, excludes evc43); it is pending priority with a current Slurm
  estimate of ~15:35 EDT. The live flagship was intentionally left untouched until the side branch
  demonstrates stable, materially better throughput.
- **2026-07-09 ~15:32** — `683715` is still healthy on **evc43** at **step 104860**, ~**148.11k
  tok/s**, with `ckpt_0104750.pt` saved. BS64/ACC4 canary **`684000`** started separately on **evc33**
  and OOMed cleanly during initialization: 78.93 GiB already in use, then unable to allocate 288 MiB.
  It did not touch the live output or consume the flagship allocation. Result: `BS=32 ACC=8` is the
  largest verified microbatch that preserves the exact 524,288-token update; reserve it for the next
  natural restart/handoff, where its measured ~4% throughput lift can be adopted safely.
- **2026-07-09 ~15:38** — **Dual-GPU return staged without interrupting the active allocation.**
  Scheduler test accepted a two-H100 request on evc33 around 16:32. Submitted isolated **`684029`**
  from `ckpt_0100000.pt` with `NG=2 BS=32 ACC=4` (same global 524,288-token update, corrected 300k
  LR schedule, separate output), to validate the higher per-GPU (~64 GB) microbatch under DDP. Added
  `--lr-total-steps` support to `ddp2_canary.sbatch` so its short run is schedule-faithful. Submitted
  **`684030`** as a dependency-held 3-day two-H100 successor after `683715`, with the same
  `NG=2 BS=32 ACC=4 CKPT=250` shape and only four CPUs. It must remain pending until the live job
  ends; retain it only if `684029` shows clean startup/stable throughput, otherwise replace it with
  the already-proven `NG=2 BS=16 ACC=8` configuration.
- **2026-07-09 ~16:22** — **Canary seeding hardening and corrected resume.** `684029` did validate
  `world=2`, `BS=32/ACC=4`, ~59 GB per-GPU memory during warmup, no NCCL/DDP issue, and steady
  throughput reaching **~278k tok/s**. It was stopped once that hardware measurement was complete
  because it was unexpectedly headed for a long duplicate run. Root cause: its requested
  `ckpt_0100000.pt` had aged out of the flagship retention window; the script logged `cp: cannot stat`
  but continued, so it trained from initialization. Its loss curve is therefore invalid for a resume
  quality gate. Fixed `ddp2_canary.sbatch`: `set -e`, fail on missing source, default to preserved
  `best_step100000.pt`, and copy preserved sources under a numbered `ckpt_` filename that train.py
  resumes. Submitted corrected **`684058`** on evc33; it logged `[resume] ... ckpt_0100000.pt -> start
  step 100001 (FRESH optimizer)`, `world=2 bs=32 accum=4`, and early loss/gnorm in band. Keep
  dependency-held `684030` only if this corrected canary completes cleanly; the live flagship remains
  healthy past step 105.6k at ~148.1k tok/s with `ckpt_0105500.pt` saved.
- **2026-07-09 ~16:58** — **Corrected two-H100 BS32 canary passed.** `684058` resumed from preserved
  100k weights at step **100001**, ran through **100239**, and completed in 472s with **no skips,
  OOM, NCCL error, or DDP hang**. Loss/gnorm stayed in the expected resumed band (loss ~1.39-1.85,
  gnorm ~0.06-0.23). Its final **~264.9k tok/s** includes compile warmup; the prior long hardware-only
  run plateaued around **278k tok/s**, consistent with a small microbatch gain over the proven
  BS16/ACC8 two-H100 ~272k band. Decision: retain dependency-held **`684030`** at
  `NG=2 BS=32 ACC=4 CKPT=250`. The live flagship remains healthy past **106.3k**, ~148.1k tok/s,
  with `ckpt_0106250.pt` saved.
- **2026-07-09 ~20:58-21:38** — **110k checkpoint preserved and locally verified.** `683715` remained
  RUNNING on evc43, healthy through **step 111050** at ~148.1k tok/s; one isolated gnorm skip at
  110259 recovered immediately. Copied `ckpt_0110000.pt` to `best_step110000.pt` on Newton; both
  hash to **`9810b7081f78dc6bb1e5fa9765b64d4b`**. The Mac transfer suffered intermittent login/drop
  failures but was resumed with SFTP `reget` rather than restarted; local
  `train/flagship_out/ckpt_0110000.pt` now matches the same md5. The numbered remote source rotated
  out during the long transfer, confirming the preserved `best_step` copy is required for custody.
  Next DR target: **120k**.
- **2026-07-10 ~02:58** — **Single-H100 throughput directive applied.** User withdrew the pending
  dual-GPU continuation in favor of maximizing the single H100. Canceled dependency-held two-H100
  `684030` without touching healthy live job `683715`. Submitted **`685084`** as a dependency-held
  single-H100 successor with `BS=32 ACC=8 CKPT=250`, preserving the exact 524,288-token update while
  using the validated ~64 GB microbatch (single-H100 canary measured ~154.5k tok/s vs ~148k live).
  Do not interrupt `683715` for this modest gain; it activates only at the natural handoff. At the
  current 148k tok/s one H100 processes ~12.8B tokens/day, so any claim of 30T tokens in 10 days
  necessarily assumes roughly 35M tok/s, i.e. a large multi-GPU fleet rather than this allocation.
- **2026-07-10 ~04:20-07:00** — **Measured single-H100 graph-capture investigation.** Isolated
  BS32/ACC8 profiler `685088` ran from preserved 110k and measured **155.35k tok/s**. It exposed
  roughly 54k CUDA launches across four complete updates; GPU time remains dominated by GEMM (35.6%)
  and FlashAttention backward (23.2%), so launch removal is a bounded optimization, not a 100x path.
  Automatic `torch.compile(reduce-overhead)` attempts `685105`/`685106` failed before a training step
  because per-forward CUDA graphs conflict with eight-way gradient accumulation; do not use that mode
  in the flagship. Whole-update graph canary `685125` reached capture but stopped safely because
  canary AdamW lacked `capturable=True`; patch must be synced/retried only after
  Newton authentication recovers. **120k is preserved on Newton:** numbered and `best_step120000.pt`
  both md5 `d5c73034b635025ba997b25b622f77f5`. The Mac transfer reached 1,017,348,096 bytes before
  Newton started refusing new login sessions; retain it and SFTP `reget` it in place, never trust it
  until the final md5 matches.
- **2026-07-10 ~07:40** — **120k local DR completed; graph-capture retry queued.** Newton access
  recovered, the resumable local transfer reached the expected 1,076,598,762 bytes, and Mac md5 now
  matches Newton exactly: `d5c73034b635025ba997b25b622f77f5`. Synced `cudagraph_canary.py` with
  canary-only `AdamW(capturable=True)` and submitted **`685209`** excluding evc43; it is pending
  priority and cannot affect the flagship. `683715` remains healthy past 121.2k at ~148.1k tok/s.
- **2026-07-10 ~09:00** — **120k capability board queued.** `683715` is healthy past 122.5k. Submitted
  isolated eval `685262` against preserved `best_step120000.pt` with the same fixed progress-board
  protocol (`N=100`, GSM8K `K=4`) as the 80k baseline; it is pending normal priority and estimated just
  after the whole-update CUDA-graph canary `685209`. Neither job shares live outputs or can displace
  the flagship.
- **2026-07-10 ~12:23** — **CUDA-graph and 120k measurement gates completed.** First graph runs
  `685209`/`685508` exposed a bad-node CUDA allocation and capturable-optimizer resume setup only;
  clean retry **`685520`** completed 80 updates from 110k with stable loss/gnorm at **158.20k tok/s**,
  57.07 GiB. That is only ~1.8% over the 155.35k BS32 compiled profile and the canary omits the
  flagship skip guard, so **CUDA graphs are rejected for integration**. Board **`685262`** on 120k
  completed: GSM8K maj@4 2/100 (80k 0/100), pass@1 1/100 (80k 3/100), MATH500 3/100 (80k 2/100),
  HumanEval 7/164 (80k 5/164), MBPP 0/100 unchanged. Treat this as noisy/mixed raw-pretrain movement,
  not evidence of meaningful reasoning yet; preserve the live run, evaluate again near 160k, and use
  an SFT variant as the next capability intervention rather than chasing marginal throughput.
- **2026-07-10 ~13:54** — **Capability data path reset around verified scale, without touching pretrain.**
  Audited the actual `response` field consumed by `train/sft.py` (not the short auxiliary `answer`
  field): core mix is structurally clean at 97,439 rows, 0 malformed/duplicates, median 96 response
  words, p90 174, and 96,994 explicit final-answer markers. The problem is therefore not answer-only
  formatting; it is that this is still only a 97k-example initial SFT and underweights procedural
  verifier-backed traces. Added `audit_sft_quality.py`, `prepare_rg_sft.py`, and atomic CPU job paths.
  Submitted `685691` to curate up to 600k independently answer-verified, eval-decontaminated
  OpenMath solutions; `685694` to generate 20k instances per Reasoning-Gym training family with
  disjoint evaluation seeds/families plus execution-verified traces; and dependency-held `685696` to
  freeze `sft_mix_reasoning_v2.jsonl` only if both finish successfully. No SFT is queued; candidate
  quality and held-out capability gates must pass first. Flagship `683715` recovered normally after
  two skipped extreme-gradient batches at 126648-126649 and remains healthy through 127.6k.
- **2026-07-10 ~14:20** — **Verified source jobs completed; pretraining corpus expansion started.**
  `685691` wrote and audited **600,000** OpenMath SFT rows: 338,610 `augmented_math`, 126,099
  `augmented_gsm8k`, 108,103 `math`, and 27,188 `gsm8k`, with median 96 and p90 182 response words.
  `685694` committed `rg_v2` with **99,808** execution-verified trace examples (median 18, p90 43
  response words) and generator-held-out eval configurations. `685696` began the frozen v2 mix build.
  Submitted CPU-only `685700` to tokenize OpenMath problem+solution documents into a separate,
  manifest-gated `shards/openmath_pt` source (5B-token cap) for a later natural relaunch; it cannot
  alter the currently running shard mixture.
- **2026-07-10 ~14:35** — **Held-out procedural capability gate added.** Added `train/eval_rg.py` and
  `train/jobs/eval_rg.sbatch`: exact-match, per-family evaluation on the `rg_v2` generator-held-out
  seeds/families. First baseline allocation `685702` failed in one second on evc26 because NVML was
  transiently unavailable before any model code executed; hardened the wrapper to wait/retry an NVML
  exit rather than abort, excluded evc26 and evc43, and resubmitted baseline **`685704`** from
  `best_step120000.pt` over 400 held-out questions. Use the identical protocol after an SFT-v2 pilot;
  no data recipe is accepted on public-board movement alone.
- **2026-07-10 ~14:55** — **Balanced baseline and isolated v2 SFT pilot completed.** The balanced
  120k procedural baseline `685706` scored **29/800 = 3.625%** over 32 held-out families; this is the
  valid raw-base reference (the prior 3/400 was knights-only). Pilot `685708` completed one v2 epoch:
  349,317 examples / 85.34M packed tokens / 2,605 updates, terminal loss ~0.46-0.54. It correctly
  initialized from `best_step120000.pt` and wrote only `train/sft_v2_120k/sft_ep1.pt`; a stale final
  echo mentioned default `sft_out`, so dependent evaluations were canceled while header+filesystem
  isolation was verified. Replacement public board `685757` now runs on that exact checkpoint; balanced
  RG `685759` is serially dependency-held after it. Flagship is healthy past 128.7k at ~148.12k tok/s.
- **2026-07-12 ~03:20** — **Network-outage reconciliation and data gate decision.** Original
  flagship `683715` completed cleanly after 2d 7h on evc43. Dependency successor **`685084`** started
  automatically on evc22, correctly resumed `ckpt_0141500.pt -> step 141501` with the planned
  one-H100 `BS=32/ACC=8` configuration, and is healthy through **166.26k** at **154.2k tok/s**.
  The missed 130k/160k rotating checkpoints cannot be recovered; immediately preserved current
  `ckpt_0166250.pt` as `best_step166250.pt` (remote md5
  `1b57c99aca966546d4d9aea7827d6ebd`) and began a resumable local `.part` DR transfer. CPU job
  `685700` completed `openmath_pt`: **5,000,000,144 tokens / 50 shards / 12,662,236 docs kept /
  165,773 eval-contaminated docs dropped**. It is approved only as a future natural-relaunch input,
  never a live-mix mutation. SFT-v2 `sft_ep1` improved GSM8K pass@1 **1/100 -> 12/100** and maj@4
  **2/100 -> 5/100**, but MATH500 fell **3/100 -> 0/100**, HumanEval **7/164 -> 6/164**, MBPP stayed
  0, and balanced held-out RG regressed **29/800 (3.625%) -> 19/800 (2.375%)**. Decision: retain it
  as a narrow GSM-style ablation result, **do not promote v2 as the final broad-reasoning recipe**;
  continue raw pretraining and re-design post-training around stronger procedural coverage before the
  next SFT pilot.
- **2026-07-12 ~03:22** — **166.25k DR custody complete; raw-base eval chain queued.** Resumable SFTP
  transfer completed locally as `train/flagship_out/ckpt_0166250.pt`; local and Newton both md5
  **`1b57c99aca966546d4d9aea7827d6ebd`**. Submitted isolated raw-base public board **`686245`** against
  the preserved 166.25k checkpoint, with balanced held-out RG **`686247`** serially after success;
  both exclude the live evc22 node. Next DR target is 170k. Do not train another broad v2 SFT variant
  until the raw-base 166k measurements and a revised procedural-curriculum design are reviewed.
- **2026-07-12 ~03:32** — **Deep capability diagnosis found an evaluation truncation defect.** Direct
  H100 transcripts of raw 166k (`686255`) show template completion, task mutation, list/string failure,
  and invalid code. Direct SFT-v2 transcripts (`686263`) show a real capability change: correct fresh
  discount/tax and fraction derivations, but failed algebra continuation, base conversion, logic,
  string/list processing, and parity code. Critically, `eval_suite.generate()` stopped at any blank
  line while SFT completions commonly put `The answer is ...` after one; old SFT benchmark results are
  undercounted. Removed that stop condition, preserved old metrics only as diagnostics, canceled their
  mixed-protocol reruns, and queued fixed-decoder public/held-out/in-training gates (`686265`,
  `686267`, `686269`). See `CAPABILITY_DIAGNOSIS.md` for ranked causes and pre-relaunch requirements.
- **2026-07-10 ~14:45** — **RG measurement bias fixed before using it for a decision.** `685704` completed
  and confirmed the raw 120k model is poor on held-out knights-and-knaves (**3/400 = 0.75%**), but the
  generator file is family-ordered, so the first 400 rows were all one family. Patched evaluator to
  shuffle each family deterministically then round-robin across families. Submitted balanced baseline
  **`685706`** from the same 120k checkpoint (`N=800`, excluding evc26/evc43). Treat `685704` as the
  knights-only baseline; use `685706` as the broad procedural comparison for every SFT-v2 pilot.
- **2026-07-10 ~14:50** — **First causal SFT-v2 experiment queued, isolated and fully gated.** Updated
  `sft.sbatch` to accept `OUT` rather than always writing `train/sft_out`. Submitted **`685708`**
  after the balanced pre-SFT baseline: 1 epoch from `best_step120000.pt` over frozen v2, output to
  `train/sft_v2_120k/`. Queued public board **`685710`** `afterok:685708` and balanced RG **`685714`**
  `afterok:685710`, so the experimental GPU work is serial and consumes no flagship resources. The
  only decision rule: retain the v2 recipe only if it improves the held-out RG gate and does not cause
  a material public-board regression; otherwise diagnose source balance/format before another run.
- **2026-07-12 ~04:10** — **Capability measurement and data-coverage repairs.** Fixed the evaluator a
  second time: it now stops only after a complete explicit final-answer line, avoiding both blank-line
  truncation and wasteful post-answer decoding; `eval_all.sbatch` now fails fast if a Slurm allocation
  has no usable CUDA device. Bad-node CPU fallback `686272` was canceled; replacement **`686277`** is
  confirmed CUDA on evc31, with `686278 -> 686279` serial RG gates. Direct smoke `686280` validated all
  15 deterministic RG tracers against fresh samples (decimal parser corrected from real prompts), so
  **`686281`** now builds isolated `rg_v3`. Audit found only 444 code examples in v2; APPS train-only
  execution-verified code pilot was added. The first loader attempt hit a current `datasets` loading-
  script restriction; corrected **`686282`** uses the official APPS train JSONL directly. Flagship
  `685084` remains healthy through 166.98k at ~154.2k tok/s; no live trainer data or model state changed.
- **2026-07-12 ~04:20** — **Data pilots cleared their first gates.** `rg_v3` generated 559,977 train
  problems and **271,452** verifier-backed traces across 15 covered families, retaining disjoint RG
  evaluation seeds/families; the job is finishing conversion/audit before commit. The corrected APPS
  train-only JSONL route (`686282`) kept **100/108** examples after three supplied I/O checks each,
  with 0 malformed, duplicate, or evaluation-overlap rows and p90 response length 182 words. Submitted
  `686283` to build a separate 3,000-example scale artifact. The CUDA-only v2 board `686277` remains
  in progress; do not interpret its first four printed samples as a score.
- **2026-07-12 ~04:25** — **RG duplicate gate repaired before promotion.** The initial `rg_v3` audit
  found 19,154 normalized-question duplicates, so no SFT mix was built from it. Added atomic question
  deduplication in `prepare_rg_sft.py` and generated a separate immutable derivative with `686284`:
  **252,298 valid traces, 0 malformed, 0 missing, 0 duplicates**, response p50/p90 19/37 words. Future
  `rg_scale` runs inherit this deduplication. Use only `rg_traces_sft_dedup.jsonl` for future SFT mix
  candidates; retain the original raw trace file for provenance.
- **2026-07-12 ~04:35** — **Broadened procedural supervision beyond arithmetic.** Fresh RG samples
  exposed answer-checkable, previously untraced number theory, filtering/sorting, Caesar, social-count,
  and self-referential logic families. Added conservative deterministic tracers for them; each recomputes
  and compares the gold answer before emitting a trace. CPU smoke `686285` validated all **25** registered
  families with nonzero fresh-sample coverage (most 80/80; intentionally conservative families retain
  only parseable items). Submitted isolated **`686286`** for `rg_v4`; it is not a replacement for v3 and
  must still pass the standard dedup/audit gate before it can appear in an SFT mix.
- **2026-07-12 ~04:45** — **Code-data harness hardened before scale.** APPS scale `686283` encountered
  a dataset row with a >4,300-digit JSON integer after writing 586 KB. It failed before any mix build;
  moved that incomplete output to `apps_train_v1.failed_686283.jsonl` for audit and never use it. The
  curator now treats that parse condition as a row-level rejection and writes through an atomic `.partial`
  path, so only a fully audited completion can claim `apps_train_v1.jsonl`. The first CodeContests schema
  probe also started materializing an entire split; canceled it and changed retry `686289` to streaming
  single-record inspection. Retry code scale is `686288`; both remain isolated from SFT/pretrain.
- **2026-07-12 ~04:55** — **Full 25-family procedural corpus passed quality gate.** `rg_v4` committed
  after direct deduplication in the normal scale path: **374,659 valid traces, 0 malformed, 0 missing,
  0 duplicate normalized questions**, response p50/p90 18/37 words. The small audit report was copied
  locally and hash-verified. Streaming-only CodeContests probe `686289` confirmed train/valid/test
  schemas with language-tagged reference solutions plus public/generated I/O tests. Train-only Python 3
  pilot `686290` kept 100 structurally clean, execution-verified examples; submitted `686291` for a
  separate 3,000-row scale artifact. Continue to keep all code and RG outputs out of a frozen mix until
  their individual final audits are available.
- **2026-07-12 ~05:15** — **Capability investigation completed its first decision gate.** Corrected
  CUDA board `686277` finished v2 at GSM8K maj@4 **6/100**, pass@1 **14/100**, MATH-500 **6/100**,
  HumanEval **6/164**, MBPP **0/100**; reject v2 from promotion. Direct prompt matrix `686306` compared
  raw 168k and v2 across 48 fresh arithmetic/base/state/sort/string/logic tasks under Q/A, plain,
  CoT, and one-shot prompts. Raw was 4/48, 4/48, 0/48, 5/48; v2 was 7/48, 4/48, 5/48, 4/48. The small
  v2 gain is template-specific, not latent reasoning. Verified 1,360 v2 prompt-token prefixes: no
  completion-mask boundary mismatch. Added `train/capability_matrix.py` and isolated job wrapper as a
  repeatable future promotion gate; no live pretrain files, SHARDS, or teacher writers were changed.
- **2026-07-12 ~05:25** — **v4 replay-capacity gate added before training.** CodeContests scale `686291`
  is still atomically writing its verified train-only artifact, so queued `686308` afterok to produce
  `code_completion_v1`, `686310` afterok to freeze the v4 mix, and `686312` afterok to tokenize that mix
  exactly as SFT will and report per-group packed sequence counts plus the repeat factor implied by the
  proposed 40/35/15/10 weights. Do not submit `sft_v4_pilot.sbatch` until this report proves code
  oversampling is defensible or the weights are revised. This is CPU-only and leaves the flagship untouched.
- **2026-07-12 ~05:35** — **Recurrent depth is stable but not earned.** Matched Mame `n_loop=1`
  (`686301`) and `n_loop=2` (`686302`) runs both completed 800 updates with one recovered gnorm skip.
  The final logged losses were statistically indistinguishable (2.4899 vs 2.4890), while recurrence
  cost 1.65x wall time (886s -> 1466s) and reduced throughput 472.7k -> 286.0k tok/s. This is a
  mechanical-validity result only; keep `n_loop=1` for the flagship until a longer paired capability
  gate shows a real benefit.
- **2026-07-12 ~05:42** — **The first broad capability audit was strengthened, not hand-waved.** Held-out
  v2 RG `686278` completed at **90/800 = 11.25%**: it learned a few narrow procedural routines
  (chain sums 20/25, string insertion 19/25, basic arithmetic 13/25) but remained zero on most
  transformation, logic, cipher, and geometry families. The raw-base board `686314` loaded rotating
  `ckpt_0168000.pt`, scored only its first GSM8K maj@4 metric (1/100), then lost the source checkpoint;
  it is invalid rather than evidence. Hardened `eval_all.sbatch` to pin a checkpoint for the entire board,
  preserved `best_step168750.pt` (md5 `e58b6b07802782517c7709c1844cb4d1`), and queued corrected raw board
  `686315` followed by isolated multi-turn adaptive interaction probe `686316`. No live model or SHARDS
  were modified.
- **2026-07-12 ~05:55** — **Restart data replay defect found and repaired forward-only.** Inspection of
  `ShardLoader` and trainer checkpoints showed that optimizer/model state resumed but the async data
  stream did not: every Slurm handoff rebuilt it from the same `DSEED=777`, allowing a repeated shuffled
  prefix. Added generation-scoped deterministic data seeds, checkpoint metadata, and `test_data_stream_resume.py`.
  A real two-stage tiny-train smoke saved generation 0 then resumed at step 2 with generation 1 and a
  distinct seed. Active `685084` is untouched; its next natural successor receives the repair. This
  reduces an unmeasured but serious replay risk, not a retroactive claim that past tokens were unique.
- **2026-07-12 ~05:58** — **v4 SFT data is frozen, but its replay budget was corrected before GPU use.**
  CodeContests `686291` committed 3,000 execution-verified train-only Python problems; `686308` converted
  3,593 deduplicated examples to completion form. `686310` froze v4 at **643,595** clean, deduplicated,
  decontaminated rows, and `686312` tokenized it exactly as SFT will: math 34,848 / procedural 24,847 /
  code 1,225 / teacher 2,006 packed sequences. The 40/35/15/10 proposal would have replayed code 7.7x
  and teacher 3.1x per epoch, so `sft_v4_pilot.sbatch` is revised to **40/47/8/5** (code 4.1x, teacher
  1.6x). Do not submit its pilot until the pinned raw-base board and adaptive direct baseline finish.
  Separate CPU-only `686317` is expanding CodeContests further for a later candidate.
- **2026-07-12 ~06:05** — **v2 overfit control closed, without rescuing v2.** In-training `686279`
  completed **98/800 = 12.25%**, only one point above held-out `686278` at **90/800 = 11.25%**. This
  confirms a few procedural routines transferred beyond exact examples, but the family distribution
  remains narrowly concentrated and corrected public math/code scores remain too low. Keep v2 rejected;
  use this result only as evidence that v4 needs broader verified coverage, not just more epochs.
- **2026-07-12 ~06:50** — **170k DR milestone complete.** `685084` reached step 170,000 on evc22 at
  ~154.2k tok/s with stable loss/gnorm, then continued cleanly. Copied numbered `ckpt_0170000.pt` to
  Newton `best_step170000.pt`; both md5 **`7ad139b6b9b537a5a3e65978f8296419`**. Resumable SFTP local
  transfer completed at 1,076,598,762 bytes; local `train/flagship_out/ckpt_0170000.pt` matches the same
  md5 before its `.part` rename. The raw 168.75k board is still completing code execution and adaptive
  probe `686316` remains dependency-held; no SFT candidate has started.
- **2026-07-12 ~07:15** — **Pinned raw baseline and direct interaction audit completed; v4 pilot started.**
  Corrected raw board `686315` completed on evc23 against pinned `best_step168750.pt`: GSM8K maj@4
  **5/100**, GSM8K pass@1 **2/100**, MATH-500 **2/100**, HumanEval **7/164**, MBPP **0/100**. Direct
  multi-turn audit `686316` completed: **1/6** correct initially, **1/6** after an explicit independent
  review, and **1/6** even with a verified intermediate fact; only the simple syllogism survived. This
  rejects a hidden-prompt/latent-correction explanation. Mirrored raw board log and adaptive JSON locally
  with matching md5s `4a066de48c450b36c89836ad53cc444e` and `e05a451a16087450a6f87764cf7a39e7`.
  Submitted isolated source-balanced v4 SFT **`686323`** on evc23 from `best_step168750.pt` to
  `train/sft_v4_168750/`, one epoch, `40/47/8/5` math/procedural/code/teacher. Separately hardened
  `curate_selfcorrect.py` to write atomically and reject duplicate normalized prompts; its new v1 asset
  has 15,000 clean unique rows (5,979 explicit repairs) and is held for a post-v4 ablation only.
- **2026-07-12 ~07:20** — **v4 submission configuration was audited and corrected before a training step.**
  The first submission `686323` logged obsolete 40/35/15/10 weights, so it was canceled at 2m45s before
  any SFT step and its created directory was preserved as `sft_v4_168750.invalid_686323_oldweights`.
  Synced the local audited job script to Newton, hash-verified it, confirmed remote
  `WEIGHTS="math=0.40 procedural=0.47 code=0.08 teacher=0.05"`, and launched replacement **`686324`**
  on evc23 to a fresh `train/sft_v4_168750_r2/` directory. `685084` on evc22 was never touched.
- **2026-07-12 ~07:35** — **V4 code-completion boundary audit found and repaired a real label-contract bug.**
  Before accepting `686324`, an exact tokenizer audit found **461/3,542** raw-completion code rows where
  separately tokenized prompt IDs were not a prefix of `tokenize(prompt + completion)` due BPE merges at
  CRLF/indent boundaries. That misplaces completion-only labels relative to inference. Canceled `686324`
  before it wrote an artifact and preserved its directory as
  `sft_v4_168750_r2.invalid_686324_maskboundary`. `train/sft.py` now independently tokenizes the prompt
  and completion then concatenates IDs; `test_sft_prompt_boundaries.py` covers both normal Q/A and CRLF
  Python headers. Local and Newton tests passed under a one-thread BLAS login-node setting. Clean r3
  **`686326`** is running on evc23 to `train/sft_v4_168750_r3/`, initial packing/weighted sampling is
  correct (math 25,275 / procedural 29,435 / code 5,010 / teacher 3,192). `685084` remains untouched.
- **2026-07-12 ~07:55** — **Clean v4 SFT completed; evaluation protocol repair applied before scoring.**
  `686326` completed one epoch/3,933 updates in 1,218s and wrote
  `train/sft_v4_168750_r3/sft_ep1.pt` (500,446,874 bytes). The first successor board `686327` was
  canceled immediately because its unset defaults would have used N=200 and GSM8K maj@8, incomparable
  to the N=100/maj@4 raw baseline. The corrected N=100/K=4 board `686332` then hit a transient NVML
  exit-6 on evc26 before decoding; `eval_all.sbatch` had an unintended `pipefail` exit in its readiness
  assignment. Patched it to retain the intended retry semantics, bash-validated and hash-synced it, then
  queued the current protocol-matched board **`686336`** on evc23 plus serial `686337` (RG N=800),
  `686338` (adaptive), and `686339` (capability matrix), all excluding evc22/evc26. No metric from
  canceled board attempts is valid. Flagship `685084` remains healthy through ~171k.
- **2026-07-12 ~08:20** — **FineWeb-Edu future curriculum source passed final artifact audit.**
  CPU job `686298` wrote `artifacts/shards/fineweb_edu_5b`: 46 nonempty shards and 4,599,762,693
  tokens from 4,139,127 kept documents. The quality/decontamination filters rejected 5,531,139
  low-quality and 1,816 eval-contaminated documents; manifest md5 is
  `05739fa1cb31a45e1c496909f9461fa1`. Independent full-shard scan `686340` found entropy 10.767--10.784,
  top-1 frequency 0.0384--0.0393, top-5 0.1559--0.1575, zero byte-fallback, and normal decoded
  educational text in sampled windows. It is therefore eligible for the **future-only** manifest-gated
  reasoning relaunch, never for a mid-run mutation of `685084`. At the same checkpoint of custody,
  flagship `685084` was healthy at step 171,490 / 154.25k tok/s with immediately recovered gnorm
  outliers. The protocol-matched v4 board has completed GSM8K: maj@4 5/100 (tie with raw) and pass@1
  14/100 (raw 2/100); this is deliberately not treated as promotion before MATH/code, held-out RG, and
  direct interaction finish.
- **2026-07-12 ~08:35** — **Evaluation reproducibility repair committed before any rerun.** The public
  board's greedy pass@1, code pass@1, held-out RG, and direct probes are deterministic. Its sampled
  GSM8K maj@4 result was not explicitly seeded, so `eval_suite.py` and `eval_code.py` now accept and
  report a fixed seed; `eval_all.sbatch` defaults `EVAL_SEED=20260712`. This cannot explain the current
  14/100 greedy GSM8K v4 result, but it prevents future sampled comparisons from being ambiguous. The
  active `686336` board is intentionally left untouched; only future submissions use the repair.
- **2026-07-12 ~08:36** — **Deep capability and verifier gates expanded without touching flagship.**
  Read the verbatim raw/v2 transcript and adaptive audit rather than inferring from loss: raw repeatedly
  continues unrelated templates, and v2 produces fluent but invalid arithmetic/base-conversion procedures.
  The partial v4 board is weak (GSM8K maj@4 5/100, pass@1 14/100, MATH-500 1/100, HumanEval 2/125), so
  it is not eligible for promotion pending the full gate. Queued the matching raw-v4 verbatim transcript
  audit `686343` after `686339`. Added and ran `fetch_gsm8k_train.py`: **7,473** labelled training rows,
  **0** normalized prompt overlaps with the held-out public evaluator. Queued isolated verifier chain
  `686345 -> 686349`: train-only k=8 student rollouts, binary verifier data, one-epoch verifier SFT,
  held-out public k=16 rollouts, and a final report with pass@1/oracle@16/verifier@16. All GPU jobs exclude
  evc22/evc26 and use no flagship or frozen-SFT output directory.
- **2026-07-12 ~08:55** — **V4 public gate rejected; primitive ablation is data-gated.** `686336` completed:
  GSM8K maj@4 **5/100**, pass@1 **14/100**, MATH-500 **1/100**, HumanEval **2/164**, MBPP **0/100**.
  The pass@1 formatting gain does not compensate for math/code regressions, so v4 cannot be promoted.
  Audit of its 374,659 procedural rows found direct coverage gaps (only 12 state-update-like rows, 77
  syllogistic-logic-like rows, and 3 correction-like rows), despite its high headline count. Built and
  audited `primitives_v1`: **210k** train and **3.5k** held-out solver-generated rows across seven missing
  operations, with 0 malformed/duplicate/overlapping prompts. V5 capacity audit `686359` measured 72,161
  packed sequences and controlled replay factors: math 0.83x, primitives 2.73x, code 2.95x, teacher 1.80x,
  procedural 0.44x. Queued raw primitive baseline `686357`, then isolated v5 `686361` and v5 primitive gate
  `686362`; no public/RG promotion board will be spent unless that held-out gate improves. Added DCLM full
  scan `686360` after tokenizer job completion. Flagship remains untouched and healthy past 172.2k.
- **2026-07-12 ~09:03** — **V5 capacity retuned before its dependency could unlock.** The first packing
  report's 40/35 math/primitives split was intentionally superseded to preserve more contest-math coverage.
  Canceled only the pending v5 jobs (no artifact existed), then reran the read-only packing gate as `686366`.
  The accepted 45/30 math/primitives mix reports **72,161** packed sequences with repeat factors math
  **0.932x**, primitives **2.344x**, code **2.948x**, teacher **1.799x**, and procedural **0.436x**.
  Replacement v5 `686367` and held-out primitive evaluator `686368` remain dependency-held after the
  running raw primitive baseline `686363`. This is a controlled data comparison, not a new flagship path.
- **2026-07-12 ~09:20** — **Direct compact-state claim tested and rejected at the pinned 170k checkpoint.**
  The first instrumentation run `686369` exposed an over-permissive code scorer, so it was not used as
  evidence. The scorer now requires a syntax-valid `is_even` AST without executing model text. Corrected
  isolated interview `686370` scored **1/8 initial, 0/8 review, 1/8 scaffold, 0/8 compact-state reuse**;
  only the simple logic constraint passed. This confirms that no prompt, verified intermediate, or
  self-produced summary currently unlocks a general solver. Canonical transcript is
  `artifacts/eval_history/deep_interaction_raw170k_r2_686370.json`, md5
  `1979bcc79cb18830cb3080a7cab85e82`. Flagship `685084` remained untouched and healthy past 172.6k.
- **2026-07-12 ~09:25** — **V4's diagnostic gate showed local transfer without broad readiness.**
  Corrected held-out procedural result `686337` is **209/800 = 26.125%**, versus V2's corrected
  `686278` **90/800 = 11.25%** on the same held-out file and seed. The gain is concentrated in simple
  equations, sorting, string relations, and chain arithmetic; it is not attributable to V4 data alone
  because V4 starts from the later 168.75k base. V4's direct adaptive test `686338` remained **1/6
  initial, 1/6 review, 0/6 scaffold**, and the public board has math/code regressions, so V4 stays
  rejected for broad promotion. Its remaining matrix/verifier chain is diagnosis only.
- **2026-07-12 ~09:30** — **V4 format-versus-execution diagnosis completed.** Matched matrix `686339`
  scored raw/V4 as **4/48 -> 4/48 Q/A**, **5/48 -> 4/48 direct**, **0/48 -> 4/48 CoT**, and
  **7/48 -> 10/48 one-shot**. V4 gains some prompted arithmetic and syllogism behavior but not native
  direct execution. Verbatim audit `686343` shows plausible prose with wrong facts (`19*17=303`,
  base-6 `254` copied to decimal, `r=14 -> 3r=14`), so its traces cannot be promoted as general
  reasoning. Retain V4 only for verifier/generator comparison; V5's primitives gate must prove actual
  atomic execution rather than output style.
- **2026-07-12 ~09:35** — **Future language curriculum weights corrected before any handoff.**
  `ShardLoader` reserves one sequence for every enabled domain before drawing its weighted remainder;
  the old nominal 25/25/50 weights would have supplied roughly **32/23/45** math/code/English at BS32.
  `flagship_language_relaunch.sbatch` now uses floor-aware weights `2 4 28 4 6 32 24`, verified by
  `test_domain_mix.py` to yield exact **25/25/50**. Added a 25B DCLM replacement builder; it requires
  the 5B pilot manifest and must receive a fresh full-shard scan before admission, never coexist with
  the pilot in one curriculum. No active training or live SHARDS changed.
- **2026-07-12 ~09:45** — **OpenR1-Math intake is now a bounded data-quality gate.** CPU schema probe
  `686380` confirmed the official `default` config exposes problem, answer, per-generation Math Verify
  / Llama-judge flags, completion flags, and UUID. Added `curate_openr1_math.py`: one completed trace
  per normalized problem, Math Verify preferred, Llama fallback only, 512-token trace cap, and project
  evalgram rejection. CPU pilot `686381` targets only 10k rows plus a quality report; it is isolated and
  cannot enter a frozen SFT mix without reviewing its yield, overlap, length, and provenance.
- **2026-07-12 ~10:00** — **OpenR1 short-trace route rejected; filtered source-solution route passed.**
  Length profile `686382/686383` found 0/255 verified R1 traces <=1024 tokens (p50 4,988), so do not
  train their verbose CoT into the 125M student. The concise `solution` field was viable (203/255 <=512),
  but its first pilot exposed 97 table artifacts, 2 parameter placeholders, and 492 near-answer-only rows.
  Added deterministic answer-explicit, table/placeholder, and >=10-novel-word filters. Corrected pilot
  `686386` produced **10,000** clean rows from 17,360 seen: 0 malformed/duplicates/exact eval overlaps/
  13-gram eval overlaps, p50 120 response words, and 0 source mutation. Submitted larger CPU-only
  candidate `686387`; it is future-SFT-only pending its final audit and source-balance decision.
- **2026-07-12 ~10:15** — **V5 atomic-transfer gate passed, but broad reasoning remains unproven.**
  Isolated source-balanced V5 (`686367`, raw-168.75k base, 45/15/5/5/30
  math/procedural/code/teacher/primitives) completed cleanly. Its disjoint 700-case primitive holdout
  `686368` is **272/700 = 38.86%** versus raw `686363` **0/700**. Gains are strongly uneven: syllogism
  100/100, string insertion 88/100, correction 47/100, state update 19/100, arithmetic 12/100,
  base conversion 4/100, and sort/deduplicate 2/100. The fresh V5 interaction audit `686388` is
  2/8 initial, 2/8 review, 1/8 scaffold, and 3/8 compact-state reuse: a narrow explicit-state benefit,
  not latent general reasoning. Matrix `686389` and protocol-matched public board retry `686401` are
  running; the first board allocation `686390` failed before decoding because its shared GPU was busy
  and is invalid. The original sequential verifier rollout `686345` could not fit its 3-hour wall time
  (50/2,000 in 40 minutes) and was canceled/archived without data use. Same-prompt batched decoding was
  added and tested; a 32-sample canary `686400` produced 160 candidates in 19 seconds. The corrected
  16k-candidate train-only verifier chain is `686402 -> 686406`. Flagship remains untouched through
  173.7k at 154.27k tok/s.
- **2026-07-12 ~10:25** — **V5 matched contract matrix completed; transfer is real but still brittle.**
  `686389` compared pinned raw 168.75k with V5 on 48 fresh cases. Native Q/A improved **4/48 -> 17/48**
  and explicit CoT **0/48 -> 11/48**, with new arithmetic, sorting, and state-update wins. Plain direct
  instruction only moved **5/48 -> 6/48**, and one-shot fell **7/48 -> 5/48**. This is an important
  demonstration that concise verified primitive SFT changes behavior, but the prompt dependence and
  zero/near-zero string and base-conversion transfer still forbid promotion. The matrix artifact is
  local/Newton hash-matched at md5 `c6aa2c5dc348a142e07445780c60a88a`; wait for full board `686401`.
- **2026-07-12 ~11:15** — **V5 broad-promotion gate rejected; fresh operator interaction reproduced the diagnosis.**
  Public board `686401` completed at GSM8K maj@4 **10/100**, greedy **9/100**, MATH-500 **3/100**,
  HumanEval **2/164**, MBPP **0/100**. Raw had 5/2/2/7/0, so the primitive curriculum can teach a
  narrow math-format gain but regresses code and is not a general-reasoning recipe. New transcript-first
  audit `686425` tested raw 168.75k and V5 against the same fresh seven cases. Raw was **1/7 initial,
  0/7 review, 1/7 verified fact, 0/7 reuse**; V5 was **3/7, 3/7, 2/7, 3/7**, limited to arithmetic,
  sorting, and logic. It still miscomputes base conversion/state updates, corrupts strings, and cannot
  emit syntax-valid Python. Neither model supplied the requested `state=` representation, so V5's three
  reuse wins do not count as latent context compaction. Saved and hash-verified canonical transcript
  `artifacts/eval_history/manual_capability_raw168750_vs_sft_v5_20260712_JOBID.json`
  (md5 `28dd0b15de2af16a10a2012f630072a1`). The protected flagship remained healthy through 174.7k.
- **2026-07-12 ~11:25** — **V6 contract curriculum passed its constructed holdout but not independent compaction.**
  One isolated epoch (`686413`) completed 4,535 updates in 1,388s without instability. On the 245-case
  r2 held-out contract set, `686414` improved raw **20/245 = 8.16%** to **142/245 = 57.96%**: Q/A 10/35,
  direct 10/35, CoT 15/35, review 28/35, scaffold 34/35, compact 11/35, reuse 34/35. The independent
  deep interview `686415` is the counterweight: only **4/8 initial, 1/8 review, 1/8 scaffold, 0/8 reuse**;
  compact outputs are arithmetically invalid. Therefore the V6 result is a useful contract-learning
  signal, not a general or latent-reasoning promotion. Matrix retry `686438` is isolated/running after
  the first allocation transient. Corrected verifier selector `686437` measured held-out GSM8K first
  pass 7/100, oracle@16 36/100, verifier@16 9/100: sampling has headroom but ranking is weak.
- **2026-07-12 ~11:58** — **V6 transfer result finalized; typed-state V7 gate started.** Matched matrix
  `686438` completed at raw -> V6 Q/A **4/48 -> 17/48**, direct **5/48 -> 10/48**, CoT **0/48 -> 21/48**,
  and one-shot **7/48 -> 7/48**. It confirms learned response contracts, not independent compaction,
  because the deep compact-reuse result remains 0/8. Fresh V3 typed-state data passed its final audit:
  315,000 train / 10,500 held-out rows, zero malformed rows, normalized duplicates, exact held-out prompts,
  or 13-gram held-out overlaps. Raw pinned state baseline `686456` finished all 420 evaluation rows before a
  duplicate-output guard made Slurm report failure: **21/420 = 5.0% answers, 0/280 exact states**. Preserve
  that artifact as valid raw evidence. Isolated V7 SFT `686467` began on evc28 from `best_step168750.pt` with
  audited group weights 0.432/0.18/0.028/0.04/0.32. It has no access to the flagship output directory.
- **2026-07-12 ~12:02** — **DCLM English pilot admitted; replacement build launched.** `686342` completed
  the decontaminated 5B DCLM pilot with 5,000,000,487 tokens in 50 shards (3,506,817 kept / 4,203,263
  seen; 1,820 eval-contaminated rows rejected). Full read-only scan `686360` completed: shard entropy,
  top-token fractions, and byte fallback are consistent with no material outlier; decoded windows are
  ordinary English and technical prose. Pilot is not added to live `SHARDS`. CPU job `686470` now builds
  a fresh 25B replacement, which must complete and pass its own full scan before future-handoff admission.

## 2. Cluster access (UCF Newton)

```bash
# Warm the auth/host key (password auth via sshpass), THEN use BatchMode for the real command:
SSHPASS="$NEWTON_PW" sshpass -e ssh -o NumberOfPasswordPrompts=1 -o ServerAliveInterval=30 \
  -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o ConnectTimeout=20 newton true
ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=20 newton '<remote command>'
```

- **User/account:** `sa305415` / SLURM account `skattel`.
- **BASE (all paths relative to this):** `/lustre/fs1/home/sa305415/shohin`
- **Python env:** `$BASE/miniforge3/bin/python` (torch + zstandard + datasets installed here).
- **Filesystem:** Lustre `/lustre/fs1` (shared, parallel). Checkpoints, shards, logs all live under BASE.
- ⚠️ **the Newton password (in git-ignored `.env` as `NEWTON_PW`) is a plaintext password committed to prompt history. PENDING for the user: rotate it.**
  Remind them; do not consider it secure.

**Partitions / constraints (learned the hard way — see §5):**
- Use **`-p normal`** with `--gres=gpu:nvidia_h100_pcie:1`. This is what all job scripts use.
- **`normal` is heavily contended** (shared H100 nodes) → transient `"CUDA-capable device(s) is/are
  busy or unavailable"` at job start. The job scripts self-heal (GPU-free wait + retry + bad-node
  exclusion). Do not panic on a single CUDA-busy line.
- **`preemptable` is INACCESSIBLE** ("Invalid qos specification" / time-limit rejects). Do not use it.
- **`highgpu` / 8×H100 = no access.** Measured single-node 2×H100 DDP is allowed after canary `681040`;
  do not attempt broader multi-node or 8×H100 changes without verified account access and a fresh canary.

---

## 3. THE CUSTODY LOOP (do this every wake-up)

You are running an autonomous `ScheduleWakeup` loop. Each wake-up: **check both jobs, act only if
something needs it, report briefly, reschedule ~2400s (40 min), and re-pass the standing prompt with
updated numbers.** The standing prompt template is in §8.

**One-shot health check (copy-paste):**
```bash
SSHPASS="$NEWTON_PW" sshpass -e ssh -o NumberOfPasswordPrompts=1 -o ServerAliveInterval=30 \
  -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o ConnectTimeout=20 newton true 2>/dev/null && echo "auth ok"
ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=20 newton 'BASE=/lustre/fs1/home/sa305415/shohin
echo "== PRETRAIN =="; squeue -u sa305415 -h -n shohin-flagship -o "%.10i %.9T %M %R"
grep -E "^step " $(ls -t $BASE/logs/flagship_*.out|head -1) | tail -1
echo "skips=$(grep -c "\[skip" $(ls -t $BASE/logs/flagship_*.out|head -1))"
# preserve every 10k checkpoint (idempotent):
NEW=$(ls -t $BASE/train/flagship_out/ckpt_[0-9]*.pt 2>/dev/null|head -1); STEP=$(basename $NEW|tr -dc 0-9|sed "s/^0*//")
if [ -n "$STEP" ] && [ $((STEP%10000)) -eq 0 ] && [ ! -f $BASE/train/flagship_out/best_step${STEP}.pt ]; then
  cp $NEW $BASE/train/flagship_out/best_step${STEP}.pt && echo "preserved best_step${STEP}.pt"; fi
echo "== CORPUS finemath3 =="; squeue -j 680324 -h -o "%T %M" || echo "(gone)"
echo "shards: $(ls $BASE/artifacts/shards/finemath3/*.u16.zst 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"'
```

**What healthy looks like:** job STATE `RUNNING`; a recent `step N loss L gnorm G` line with **loss <
2.7** and **gnorm ~0.1** (occasional spikes to 0.1–0.2 are fine); tok/s ~149k; skips increasing only
slowly (a few per hour). The trainer's own guards (§7) protect against bad batches; your job is
liveness + milestones, not babysitting every loss wobble.

**Why we preserve every 10k ckpt:** the trainer keeps only the last 3 `ckpt_NNNNNNN.pt` (rotates the
rest). We `cp` each 10k-multiple to `best_stepNNNNN.pt` so it's never rotated away — gives us a decay
ladder for later ablations and a rollback point.

**Reporting discipline:** report **milestones only** (60k decayed numbers, extension launched, corpus
done, weekly progress). Otherwise a one-line "both healthy — step X, shards Y" is enough. The user is
asleep; don't spam.

---

## 4. MILESTONE TRANSITIONS (the important part — get these right)

### 4A. At 60k: FEEDBACK + EXTEND

**Trigger:** pretrain job `680149` is gone from `squeue` **AND** `flagship_out/ckpt_final.pt` exists
(or the log ends with `[done] 60000 steps ...`), i.e. training reached step 60000.

This is the **first decayed checkpoint** — the WSD decay (48k→60k) anneals in the real capability
gains, so numbers here are the first honest read on the model. Two things happen in parallel:

**(a) FEEDBACK — SFT the 60k checkpoint and run the full benchmark board.**
```bash
# First sync the live teacher-data snapshot and SFT tooling from the Mac to Newton.
# This is safe: it copies to separate files and never edits active local writers.
cd /Users/sairamen/projects/shohin
rsync -av pipeline/build_sft_mix.py newton:/lustre/fs1/home/sa305415/shohin/pipeline/
rsync -av train/jobs/sft.sbatch newton:/lustre/fs1/home/sa305415/shohin/train/jobs/
rsync -av artifacts/sft/hy3_reasoning*.jsonl artifacts/sft/rgym.jsonl \
  newton:/lustre/fs1/home/sa305415/shohin/artifacts/sft/

# On a FREE node (exclude evc22 so we don't fight the next pretrain; exclude known-bad nodes).
# Default SFT now builds artifacts/sft/sft_mix_core.jsonl from verified/deduped sources.
ssh newton 'BASE=/lustre/fs1/home/sa305415/shohin
sbatch --exclude=evc22,$(cat $BASE/train/bad_nodes.txt 2>/dev/null|sort -u|paste -sd,) \
  $BASE/train/jobs/sft.sbatch'
# sft.sbatch defaults INIT to the newest flagship ckpt (the 60k one), DATA = curated sft_mix_core.
# Set SFT_BASELINE=1 only if you need the old clean baseline. It writes sft_out/sft_ep{1,2,3}.pt.

# When sft_out/sft_ep3.pt exists, run the board:
ssh newton 'BASE=/lustre/fs1/home/sa305415/shohin
sbatch --export=ALL,N=100,K=1 --exclude=evc22,$(cat $BASE/train/bad_nodes.txt 2>/dev/null|sort -u|paste -sd,) \
  $BASE/train/jobs/eval_all.sbatch'
# Board = GSM8K maj@8 + GSM8K pass@1 + MATH-500 + HumanEval + MBPP. Reads newest sft_ep*.pt by default.
```
Local MPS fallback if the cluster is jammed: `rsync` `sft_ep3.pt` + tokenizer down, run
`train/eval_suite.py` and `train/eval_code.py` on the Mac (slow — pass@1, small N; MBPP is
pathologically slow on MPS, skip or tiny-N it).

→ **REPORT to the user:** the decayed GSM8K / MATH-500 / HumanEval / MBPP numbers **vs the 5% GSM8K /
7.5% HumanEval plateau** from the undecayed 28k/32k prelim. The question we're answering: *did the LR
decay convert the plateau into real gains?* This tells us whether the recipe is working before we
commit two weeks to the long run.

**(b) EXTEND — relaunch pretraining from 60k to 300k (~157B tokens, ~2 weeks).**
```bash
# FIRST: if finemath3 corpus is done (manifest.json present / job gone), add it to the SHARDS line in
# train/jobs/flagship.sbatch so the extended run trains on the bigger, math-richer corpus:
#   SHARDS="$BASE/artifacts/shards/finemath4 $BASE/artifacts/shards/openwebmath \
#           $BASE/artifacts/shards/code_python $BASE/artifacts/shards/finemath3"
# (Edit the file on the cluster with sed/Edit; verify the dir has *.u16.zst shards + manifest.json first.)

ssh newton 'BASE=/lustre/fs1/home/sa305415/shohin
sbatch --export=ALL,STEPS=300000,LRMUON=0.005,LRADAM=1e-3,DSEED=777 \
  --exclude=$(cat $BASE/train/bad_nodes.txt 2>/dev/null|sort -u|paste -sd,) \
  $BASE/train/jobs/flagship.sbatch'
```
Notes on the extend:
- `--resume` (default in flagship.sbatch) picks up the newest `flagship_out/ckpt_*.pt`. **Caveat:**
  `ckpt_final.pt` has no optimizer state; the newest numbered `ckpt_0060000.pt` (or nearest) does.
  Confirm resume starts near step 60000 with optimizer state — check the `[resume] ... -> start step`
  line in the new log. If it resumed `ckpt_final.pt` (fresh optimizer), that's acceptable but not
  ideal; prefer a numbered ckpt.
- `STEPS=300000` re-scopes the WSD schedule so decay now runs **240k→300k**. LR is lowered
  (`LRMUON=0.005`, was 0.01) for the longer, more-converged regime.
- **After launching, UPDATE the standing ScheduleWakeup prompt: STEPS target → 300000**, and update
  §1 LIVE STATE here.
- New checkpoint-preserve cadence: keep every 10k as before (70000, 80000, ...).

### 4B. When finemath3 corpus finishes
- Verify: `ls artifacts/shards/finemath3/*.u16.zst | wc -l` (~120 shards ≈ 25B) and
  `artifacts/shards/finemath3/manifest.json` exists; job `680324` gone from squeue.
- It gets folded into the extended run's SHARDS (see 4A(b)). If the extend already launched without
  it, that's fine — fold it in at the *next* relaunch. Don't kill a healthy pretrain just to add data.

### 4C. Further corpus expansion (opportunistic, CPU jobs — cheap, do it)
More/better data is one of our two levers. When a CPU node is free, tokenize more reasoning-dense data
into new shard dirs, then add them to SHARDS on the next relaunch:
- **OpenMathInstruct-2** `problem` + `generated_solution` → `shards/openmath_pt` (decontaminate vs
  `artifacts/evals/evalgrams.pkl` first — reuse `pipeline/tokenize_shards.py` + the decontam logic).
- **More code** (Stack-Edu / bigger `code_python` pull) → `shards/code_python2`.
- Keep the mix reasoning-tilted (~45–55% web / 25–30% code / 20–25% math per DATA.md), but we're
  deliberately over-weighting math/code for a reasoning specialist.

---

## 5. FAILURE MODES & RECOVERY PLAYBOOK

**Pretrain job died / disappeared from squeue before step 60000.**
Resubmit (single GPU, NOT preemptable, exclude bad nodes):
```bash
ssh newton 'BASE=/lustre/fs1/home/sa305415/shohin
sbatch --export=ALL,LRMUON=0.005,LRADAM=1e-3,DSEED=777,STEPS=60000 \
  --exclude=$(cat $BASE/train/bad_nodes.txt 2>/dev/null|sort -u|paste -sd,) \
  $BASE/train/jobs/flagship.sbatch'
```
`--resume` reloads the newest checkpoint automatically — **no progress lost** back to the last
`ckpt_every`=1000 save. Confirm the new log shows `[resume] ... -> start step ~N`.

**CUDA-busy at job start (`device(s) is/are busy or unavailable`).**
Harmless infra contention on shared `normal` nodes. The job script already: (1) waits up to ~5 min for
GPUs to free, (2) retries the launch 4×, (3) if it logged zero steps, records the node in
`train/bad_nodes.txt` and **auto-resubmits excluding it**. Let it self-heal. Only intervene if
`bad_nodes.txt` grows past ~12 (auto-requeue stops) — then manually resubmit later when the cluster
calms down.

**Long run of skips (trainer prints `[skip:...]`).** The trainer skips any non-finite / loss-spike
(>2× EMA) / grad-spike (>8× gnorm EMA) step **entirely** (no capitulation cap). A few skips/hour is
normal. **≥300 consecutive skips → the trainer ends the run cleanly** (best ckpt preserved) so it
surfaces in monitoring — that means a genuinely bad data region or real divergence. If you see that,
resubmit with `--resume` (drops to a fresh data-shuffle offset via DSEED) and, if it recurs at the
same step, investigate the shards with `pipeline/scan_shards.py` / `pipeline/peek_batch.py`.

**Divergence (loss climbing, not just wobbling).** This was the big historical bug. **Root cause was
NOT the optimizer — it was the dataloader serving 200M-token monodomain blocks** (contiguous single-
domain shards → the model over-specialized then took a loss shock at each domain boundary, and at
135M that destabilized training around step ~6400). **FIXED** by the domain-interleaved dataloader
(`train/data.py`): one read stream per domain, every batch round-robins across all domains, so every
batch is a math+code+web blend. See `DIVERGENCE_DIAGNOSIS.md` for the full writeup. If loss genuinely
diverges again: verify `data.py` still interleaves (don't let anyone "optimize" it back to contiguous
reads), check for a corrupt shard, roll back to the last good `best_step*.pt`.

**Corpus-expansion job (680324) died.** Non-critical — it's CPU tokenization, not the model. Restart
it via its job script in `pipeline/jobs/` (or rerun `pipeline/tokenize_shards.py` for finemath-3plus
pointed at `shards/finemath3`). It resumes by skipping already-written shards. The pretrain does not
depend on it finishing.

**SSH fails / VPN drop.** The user is on a VPN to reach Newton; transient auth failures happen. Retry
the `sshpass` warm-up, then the BatchMode command. If it persists across several cycles, note it in a
report but keep rescheduling — the cluster jobs run fine without your connection.

**"Both jobs gone and I can't tell why."** Check `sacct -u sa305415 --starttime today -o
JobID,JobName,State,ExitCode,Elapsed` for exit codes, and tail the newest `logs/flagship_*.out`.

**Cluster / VPS totally lost (disaster recovery).** There is a local, fully-resumable backup on the
Mac at `train/flagship_out/ckpt_0049000.pt` (step 49k, model + Muon + AdamW state; see §1 for md5).
To rebuild elsewhere: recreate the env (`miniforge3` + torch + zstandard), re-upload the corpus shards
(or re-tokenize from `pipeline/`), put the backup ckpt in the `--out` dir, and launch `train.py`/
flagship.sbatch with `--resume` — it reloads weights **and** optimizer momentum and continues. The
backup is refreshed at each 10k milestone, so at worst you lose <10k steps. Weights-only fallbacks
(older `*.model.pt`, e.g. step 15k) also exist but resume with a fresh optimizer (`--fresh-opt`).

---

## 6. DATA INVENTORY (exact paths under BASE)

**Pretrain corpus — `artifacts/shards/` (zstd uint16 token shards, ~200M tok each):**
| dir | tokens | domain |
|---|---|---|
| `finemath4/` | 6.6B | high-quality math web (FineMath-4+) |
| `openwebmath/` | 14B | math web (OpenWebMath) |
| `code_python/` | 16.8B | Python code |
| `finemath3/` | **25.0B ✅ DONE** | FineMath-3+ (125 shards, decontaminated) — nearly doubles corpus, **triples math** |
| **total available** | **62.4B** | finemath4 + openwebmath + code_python + finemath3 (folds in at 60k relaunch) |

**SFT sets — `artifacts/sft/`:**
| file | count | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `sft_mix_core.jsonl` | ~82k and growing | **Default SFT mix** built by `pipeline/build_sft_mix.py`: frozen snapshot of OpenMath + Reasoning-Gym + code + verified teacher traces, deduped by question. Rebuild before each SFT after syncing latest local teacher files to Newton. |
| `openmath2.jsonl` | 100k | verified (boxed==answer) + decontaminated + concise (≤400 tok) + eval-aligned ("The answer is X."). **Baseline SFT.** |
| `rgym.jsonl` | 995 | Reasoning-Gym procedural CoT (diversity) |
| `code.jsonl` | 446 | MBPP train+val, execution-verified, decontaminated |
| `hy3_reasoning*.jsonl` | ~26.9k and growing | Live verified teacher fleet output (hy3 / Nemotron / GLM / Claude / minimax). **Do not train directly from live files**; snapshot via `build_sft_mix.py`. |
| `self_correct.jsonl` | 15k | arithmetic self-correction traces (all answers verified). **ABLATION-only** — NOT in baseline SFT. Measures baseline vs baseline+self-correction. |
| `openmath2_concise_2M.clean.jsonl` | ~2M | large concise set — reserved for the **FINAL** SFT (upgrade from the 100k baseline once the recipe is proven). |

**Eval sets — `artifacts/evals/`:** `gsm8k.jsonl`, `math500.jsonl`, `humaneval_full.jsonl` (164),
`mbpp_full.jsonl`, and **`evalgrams.pkl`** (70,643 13-grams from all eval questions — the
decontamination bloom filter; every SFT/corpus set is checked against it).

**Tokenizer:** `artifacts/shohin-tok-32k.json` — 32k BPE, single-digit number tokenization. The
compact vocab is deliberate (see DATA.md §tokenizer): a 32k tied embedding ≈18M params vs ~87M for a
128k vocab, so the saved params buy reasoning depth. **Do not change the tokenizer** — it's baked into
every shard and checkpoint.

---

## 7. ARCHITECTURE & CODE MAP (frozen — don't change mid-run)

**Model (`train/model.py`)** — deep-thin GQA transformer, modded-nanoGPT class:
- 30 layers, d_model 576, 9 query heads / 3 KV heads (GQA), d_ff 1536 (SwiGLU), seq_len 2048,
  vocab 32768, **~135M params** (tied embeddings, counted once).
- RoPE (half-split / NeoX, θ=50k), RMSNorm (fp32 internal), QK-norm, z-loss (1e-4), fp32 logits+loss.
- **KV cache** for inference: `forward(..., cache, pos, return_cache=True)` — training path
  (`cache=None,pos=0`) is byte-identical to before the cache was added.
- **Latent recursion** (`cfg.n_loop`, default 1 = off): re-runs the block stack N times (weight-shared
  extra depth). An ablation-gated reasoning bet; `n_loop=1` is byte-identical to a normal forward.

**Trainer (`train/train.py`)** — Muon(+AdamW), WSD LR, bf16 autocast, torch.compile, DDP-capable
(we now run either single-GPU or measured single-node 2-GPU chunks):
- Muon (Newton-Schulz orthogonalized, `train/muon.py`) on matmul params, AdamW on the rest. `--no-muon`
  bisection flag exists.
- WSD schedule (`wsd_lr`): warmup → stable (LR=1.0) → linear decay over last `decay_frac=0.2` to
  `final=0.1`. So for `--steps 60000`: decay runs 48k→60k.
- **Guards (the anti-divergence safety net):** every step measures pre-clip grad norm; **skips**
  (applies no update) any step that is non-finite, a loss-spike (>2× loss EMA), or a grad-spike (>
  `--gnorm-mult`× gnorm EMA, default 8). No capitulation cap. 300 consecutive skips → clean stop.
- DDP-safe: all-reduces loss_acc so ranks make the same skip decision; `set_device` before NCCL init.
- Checkpoints every `--ckpt-every` (1000) as `ckpt_NNNNNNN.pt` (keeps last 3), plus `ckpt_final.pt`
  (model-only) at the end. Full ckpts carry `{model, opt_muon, opt_adam, cfg, step}`.
- CONFIGS: `tiny` (smoke), `mame` (12L/384, ~30M ablation proxy), `shohin` (flagship).

**Dataloader (`train/data.py`)** — **domain-interleaved** (the divergence fix). See §5. Do not revert
to contiguous shard reads.

**Eval:**
- `train/eval_suite.py` — GSM8K / MATH-500, sampling generation + self-consistency **maj@k** (majority
  vote), answer extractors (`extract_gsm8k`, `extract_boxed`).
- `train/eval_code.py` — HumanEval / MBPP, **sandboxed execution** (subprocess + unit tests, timeout
  8s). Separate `HE_STOPS` (aggressive single-function truncation) vs `MBPP_STOPS` (lighter, allows
  multiple functions — a bug was fixed here where multi-function MBPP solutions got chopped).
- `train/eval.py` — quick generation with KV cache.

**SFT (`train/sft.py`)** — completion-masked (loss only on answer tokens, `ignore_index=-1`), packs
prompt+answer+eos to seq_len. Prompt format: `"Question: {q}\nAnswer:"`. Saves model-only
`{model, cfg, step="sft_epN"}` checkpoints.

**Curation (`pipeline/`):** `sft_curate.py` (verified+decontaminated+concise+eval-aligned math),
`curate_code.py` (execution-verified MBPP), `curate_selfcorrect.py` (synthetic self-correction),
`tokenize_shards.py` (corpus → shards), `scan_shards.py` / `peek_batch.py` (shard diagnostics),
`decontam*.py` + `fetch_evals.py` (eval-set decontamination).

**Job scripts (`train/jobs/`):** `flagship.sbatch` (pretrain, self-healing), `sft.sbatch` (feedback
SFT), `eval_all.sbatch` (full board + progress board). All have GPU-free-wait + retry; flagship also
does bad-node exclusion + auto-requeue. `eval_all.sbatch` supports `TARGET_STEP`, `RUN_TAG`, `N`, and
`K`, writes per-run logs under `artifacts/eval_history/`, and appends parsed task metrics to
`artifacts/eval_history/metrics.jsonl` for checkpoint-over-time tracking.

---

## 8. THE STANDING SCHEDULEWAKEUP PROMPT (re-pass each cycle, update numbers)

Each wake-up, after checking/acting/reporting, call `ScheduleWakeup(delaySeconds≈2400, ...)` re-passing
the prompt below with the step/shard numbers updated. Use ~1200s at transitions (waiting on a job to
appear/finish). This is the loop that keeps the model in custody while the user sleeps.

> MULTI-WEEK SoTA PRETRAINING PUSH on the single GPU [...]. PARAMOUNT: keep pretrain ALIVE. STATE:
> (A) PRETRAIN job <id> on <node> (~step <N>, loss ~1.6–1.8, 149k tok/s) with --steps <TARGET>;
> decays <d0>–<TARGET>, ends ~<TARGET> = decayed feedback. (B) CORPUS job 680324 on evc1 writing
> finemath3 (<S> shards ~<B>B; 25B target). [then the EACH-CYCLE checklist, the AT-60k FEEDBACK+EXTEND
> block, further-corpus, reschedule cadence, and the "report milestones only" rule — see the live
> prompt being passed; §3 + §4 here are the authoritative expansion of it.]

The full current prompt text is whatever the last `ScheduleWakeup` passed — this runbook (§3, §4) is
its authoritative, expanded form. If the prompt and this file ever disagree, **this file wins** and
you should fix the next prompt to match.

---

## 9. ROADMAP TO SoTA (the plan beyond 60k)

1. **60k decayed feedback** (§4A(a)) — first honest numbers. Decide the recipe is working.
2. **Extend to 300k** (~157B tokens, ~2 weeks) on the finemath3-expanded corpus (§4A(b)). This is the
   main "more tokens + more data" bet.
3. **Grow the corpus further** (§4C) and fold in at each relaunch — OpenMathInstruct-2 as reasoning-
   dense pretraining, more code.
4. **Periodic branch-decay previews** during the long run: if a second GPU is briefly free, branch a
   short LR-decay from the current checkpoint on a spare node to preview capability without disturbing
   the main run. (Optional; the main run is sacred.)
5. **FINAL SFT** once pretraining converges: upgrade from the 100k baseline to the ~2M concise set,
   add a reasoning mid-train, self-consistency at eval, and run the ablations:
   - baseline SFT **vs** baseline + `self_correct.jsonl` (does self-correction help?),
   - `mame` proxy `n_loop=2` **vs** `n_loop=1` (does latent recursion help before spending it on the
     flagship?).
6. **Report vs MobileLLM-R1-140M** on the full board. That comparison is the finish line.

Guardrails throughout: never train on unverified or contaminated data; keep traces short/concise;
math is the riskiest domain to shorten (needs precise intermediate values) — verify hard.

---

## 10. PENDING FOR THE USER
- **Rotate the Newton password the Newton password (in git-ignored `.env` as `NEWTON_PW`)** (it's in prompt history / plaintext). Remind at next
  interactive contact.

---

## 11. DATA EXPANSION PLAN (active — user green-lit all four + a teacher, 2026-07-07)

Data is the #1 SoTA lever and all of this runs on CPU / external API — **none of it touches the GPU
pretrain**, so it proceeds in parallel with the custody loop. Context: the 300k run consumes ~157B
tokens but the corpus is 62.4B (~2.5 epochs), so more *unique* reasoning-dense tokens directly help.

**★ TEACHER (free this week — time-boxed, use it):** `hermes` CLI (Nous Research agent), model
**`tencent/hy3:free`** via Nous Portal (authed on the Mac at `~/.hermes/`). One-shot:
`hermes -z "<prompt>" -m tencent/hy3:free` → clean text on stdout (~10s/call, CLI-startup-bound).
`hermes proxy` exposes an OpenAI-compatible endpoint for high-concurrency scale (not yet set up).
Auth auto-refreshes. This unblocks our thesis (short-CoT distillation), previously GPU-gated.

1. **Distill verified traces across MANY reasoning domains (highest value).** `pipeline/
   hermes_distill.py` — rejection-sampled: problem(+gold) → hermes → extract answer → verify vs gold →
   keep ONLY correct → curated SFT JSONL (`{question,response,answer,source}`). Handles answer types
   `gsm8k`(numeric) / `boxed`(math) / `mc`(multiple-choice letter) / `exact`(yes-no). Parallel,
   resumable (skips emitted qhashes), decontam-capable. `pipeline/fetch_problems.py` builds normalized
   TRAIN banks (a prebuilt teacher prompt + verifiable gold per row).
   - **Bank:** `artifacts/problems/combined.jsonl` (**~54.4k / 8 domains:** gsm8k, math, sciq,
     commonsenseqa, openbookqa, arc_easy/challenge, **reclor=logic**) = math + science + commonsense +
     logic. Each channel reads it, writes its own `hy3_reasoning*.jsonl`, resumable (skips done qhashes).
   - **MULTI-PROVIDER FLEET (run them all — max throughput + teacher diversity).** Keys in git-ignored
     `.env`. **Provider limits (learned):** OpenRouter free = **1,000 req/DAY** (not for bulk; resets
     daily) · NVIDIA free = per-minute RPM (a couple models at low conc) · Nous Portal (hermes CLI) =
     **no daily cap** → the reliable bulk workhorse. Relaunch any dead channel (all resume):
     ```
     cd pipeline
     export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=$(grep '^OPENROUTER_API_KEY=' ../.env|cut -d= -f2-)
     export NVIDIA_API_KEY=$(grep '^NVIDIA_API_KEY=' ../.env|cut -d= -f2-)
     # BULK (no cap): Nous hy3 CLI          -> hy3_reasoning.jsonl
     nohup python3 hermes_distill.py --problems ../artifacts/problems/combined.jsonl --out ../artifacts/sft/hy3_reasoning.jsonl --backend hermes --model tencent/hy3:free --concurrency 12 --timeout 90 --source hy3 > <scr>/hy3_reasoning.log 2>&1 &
     # STRONG teacher: NVIDIA nemotron-ultra -> hy3_reasoning_nemotron.jsonl  (80% yield)
     nohup python3 hermes_distill.py --problems ../artifacts/problems/combined.jsonl --out ../artifacts/sft/hy3_reasoning_nemotron.jsonl --backend nvidia --model nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b-a55b --concurrency 6 --timeout 120 --source nemotron > <scr>/nemotron.log 2>&1 &
     # NVIDIA minimax (conc 3 — errors higher; drop if >50% err)  -> hy3_reasoning_minimax.jsonl
     nohup python3 hermes_distill.py --problems ../artifacts/problems/combined.jsonl --out ../artifacts/sft/hy3_reasoning_minimax.jsonl --backend nvidia --model minimaxai/minimax-m3 --concurrency 3 --timeout 120 --source minimax > <scr>/minimax.log 2>&1 &
     ```
   - **Add when available:** OpenRouter hy3 (`--backend openrouter --model tencent/hy3:free --concurrency 24`)
     as a burst channel until its 1,000/day resets; **GLM-5.2** (`--backend nvidia --model z-ai/glm-5.2`)
     when it's no longer DEGRADED (retry a raw curl each cycle — it's the SoTA teacher, high value).
   - **Next:** more volume from NuminaMath / OpenMathInstruct-2 problems; Reasoning-Gym procedural
     (`pip install reasoning_gym` on the cluster, not the 8 GB Mac). Teacher vocab irrelevant (32k retok).
2. **Reasoning-Gym mass generation (free CPU, unlimited, decontam-proof).** Scale `pipeline/
   gen_reasoning_gym.py` to billions of tokens of verified procedural math/logic → shards for PT + SFT.
   Most on-target data for a reasoning specialist; currently under-used (~1k SFT rows only).
3. **Corpus expansion (cluster CPU, compute-node sbatch — NOT login node).** `tokenize_shards.py` now
   has `--text-cols` concat. Targets → new shard dirs: OpenMathInstruct-2 (`--text-cols problem
   generated_solution` → `shards/openmath_pt`), a big **MegaMath** slice, more code. Decontam vs
   `evals/evalgrams.pkl`. Fold into SHARDS at each relaunch.
4. **Recipe upgrades for the 300k relaunch (§4A b):**
   - **Decay-phase annealing** — shift the data mix toward premium reasoning data over the 240k–300k
     decay window (mid-training "anneal on the good stuff"), instead of just lowering LR on the same mix.
   - **Overlap:** **settled for the next handoff:** FineMath-4+ is contained in FineMath-3+, so exclude
     FineMath-4 as a separate directory. Its inclusion creates narrow replay rather than new coverage.
   - **Mix ratio:** the guarded `flagship_language_relaunch.sbatch` is canonical; the convenience
     `flagship_reasoning_relaunch.sbatch` mirrors its source policy. Both use OpenWebMath, FineMath-3,
     OpenMath, code, and scanned 25B FineWeb-Edu/DCLM replacements. Their floor-aware BS32 weights
     produce an effective **24.8% math / 25.1% code / 50.1% educational English** mix and continue to
     **600k absolute steps**. Never add an unscanned partial directory or either 5B pilot to SHARDS.

**Time-box note:** the hy3 teacher is free **this week** — prioritize distillation volume while it lasts.

---

* **2026-07-12 ~12:41** — **V7 typed-state gate closed: format transfer without general reasoning.**
  `686467` completed in 1,587s and its exact held-out state evaluation `686471` reached **307/420 answers
  (73.10%)** and **169/280 exact typed states (60.36%)**, with repair 128/140 answers + 132/140 states and
  reuse 140/140 answers. Fresh independent deep interview `686484` was instead **1/8 initial, 1/8 review,
  1/8 with a verified fact, and 0/8 compact reuse**. It fails basic arithmetic after the correct product is
  supplied, base conversion, state updates, sorting, string manipulation, and valid Python. V7 is rejected
  for general reasoning/latent compaction; local/Newton artifacts were copied and md5 verified:
  state `1f9fe0b2993d1a9dafc98cd2d7943887`, deep `c4963fae52d5ac9c38614e77f93f98c8`. A separate raw-vs-V7
  human-authored transcript job was submitted; two generic CUDA allocations failed before inference and are
  explicitly not model evidence. Later generic allocations showed the same CUDA fault and were canceled;
  the completed local-MPS transcript is recorded below. Flagship remains untouched.
- **2026-07-12 ~12:50** — **Second direct V7 interview and future corpus correction.** Generic Slurm
  H100 allocations repeatedly failed CUDA preflight before loading a checkpoint, so no score was inferred
  from them. The same seven-case raw-vs-V7 transcript completed locally on MPS and was copied back to
  Newton: raw **1/7 initial, 0/7 review, 1/7 verified fact, 0/7 reuse**; V7 **2/7, 2/7, 0/7, 1/7**.
  V7's only wins are arithmetic/state templates and it remains zero on base conversion, logic, sort,
  string, and valid Python; hash `a6d8c25cb3482cd37026bbc85306008f`. Future-only relaunch now excludes
  FineMath-4 because it is contained in FineMath-3, requires the scanned 25B DCLM replacement, and
  uses a tested effective **24.8% math / 25.1% code / 50.1% educational-English** BS32 curriculum.
- **2026-07-12 ~13:05** — **Future handoff target corrected before it could silently no-op.**
  `train.py --steps` is an absolute global bound and the active narrow-data phase already ends at 300k.
  The future `flagship_reasoning_relaunch.sbatch` had inherited `STEPS=300000`, which would resume the
  newest 300k checkpoint and immediately write no updates. Its default is now **600,000** with an
  explicit comment; the language-balanced data transition remains future-only and still requires the
  scanned DCLM 25B manifest.
- **2026-07-12 ~13:10** — **Language diversity scaled and relaunch scripts consolidated.** FineWeb-Edu
  pilot size (4.6B) would still replay several times in the 600k continuation, so CPU job **`686526`**
  now builds a 25B replacement with the same quality/decontamination filters and a required fresh scan.
  The guarded canonical `flagship_language_relaunch.sbatch` is aligned with the mirrored convenience
  relaunch: both target 600k absolute steps, exclude FineMath-4 as a FineMath-3 subset, and require
  OpenWebMath / code / FineMath-3 / OpenMath / FineWeb-25B / DCLM-25B at effective 24.8/25.1/50.1
  math/code/English. No live SHARDS changed.
- **2026-07-12 ~13:17** — **Shard decontamination strengthened before language data could be admitted.**
  Found that `tokenize_shards.py` only loaded historical `evalgrams.pkl`, whereas the SFT mixer also scans
  every current eval JSONL directly. Added `--eval-glob`, short-prompt coverage, manifest accounting for
  pickle/direct gram counts, and a regression test. The first 25B partials (`686470`: 2.0G; `686526`:
  134M) are preserved under `*.pre_live_eval_gate` audit names and excluded from use. CPU replacements
  **`686529` DCLM** and **`686530` FineWeb-Edu** restart with the stricter gate. Flagship untouched.
- **2026-07-12 ~13:38** — **Direct-capability diagnosis turned into enforceable data gates.** The live
  raw model remains a weak general reasoner despite stable loss/throughput; independent raw/V7 interviews
  establish failures in arithmetic, base conversion, transformations, Python, review, verified-fact use, and
  compact-state reuse. The first clean cross-family verifier derivative packed to only 737 sequences, so
  verifier SFT is blocked rather than repeated. `bec11a4` adds normalized verifier-prompt dedup. A
  10,000-question answer-checked train-only RG bank completed as `686535`; isolated V4-generator rollout
  `686536` (16 candidates/question) runs on evc25, followed only on success by data/packing gates
  `686540 -> 686541`. Fresh DCLM/FineWeb full scans `686538`/`686539` are dependency-held after their
  direct-live-eval-decontaminated 25B CPU builds. The flagship remains untouched through step 177,000.
- **2026-07-12 ~13:48** — **Fresh hands-on raw-model interview reproduced the failure.** Local MPS ran
  a seven-case five-turn audit directly against the preserved 170k raw checkpoint, then copied the exact
  transcript to Newton with matching md5 `9cd3216365b5292851e298bee4a1aeef`. Result: **1/7 initial,
  0/7 review, 1/7 verified-fact use, 0/7 compact reuse**. The only passing case was the simple logic
  constraint. The arithmetic case repeats `29 x 16 = 496` and never subtracts after the correct product
  is supplied; base conversion, state transitions, list/string transformations, and valid Python all fail.
  This is direct capability evidence, not a loss-curve inference; no general-reasoning or latent-state
  claim is permissible from the current raw model.
- **2026-07-12 ~14:00** — **Future data admission tightened and verified code advanced.** `scan_shards.py`
  now emits atomic JSON reports and `approve_shard_scan.py` creates an explicit manifest/report hash-bound
  approval after decoded-content/outlier review; `flagship_language_relaunch.sbatch` and its compatibility
  mirror now require both 25B language approvals, the newest explicit resume checkpoint, >=24.5B tokens,
  and <=1% byte fallback. Tests passed locally and on Newton. TACO full audit `686514` retained **250/250**
  pilot programs after all supplied test replay with zero quality/eval-overlap failures; its validated
  artifact is backed up locally and remains separate algorithmic code. `686552 -> 686553` now scales that
  same gate to 3k examples. Flagship remains healthy through step 177,250.
- **2026-07-12 ~14:10** — **TACO source-order bias was caught before admission.** The already-pending
  3k scale `686552` began while the deterministic shuffled-selection improvement was being validated, so
  it is retained only as a non-admissible prefix control rather than canceled mid-run. `curate_taco_verified.py`
  now applies a seeded 10k-row streaming shuffle buffer; only `686554 -> 686555` can feed a transfer
  candidate. The canonical full audit also now emits matched/kept/source-scan progress every 100 programs.
  Local/Newton tests and shell validation passed; no flagship or frozen SFT mix changed.
- **2026-07-12 ~14:16** — **Algorithmic-code packing is now an explicit gate.** Added tested
  `build_algorithmic_code_candidate.sbatch`, which freezes only a full-test-verified source through the
  standard decontamination/deduplication audit, rejects unexpected training groups or fewer than 1,000
  usable rows, and never launches SFT. Remote pilot smoke retained 244 clean `algorithmic_code` rows (five
  overlong responses and one eval n-gram overlap were correctly excluded). Shuffled all-test success now
  unlocks `686560` candidate freeze and `686561` 2,048-token packing inspection, not training.
- **2026-07-12 ~14:25** — **Verifier volume can no longer be waived by an operator mistake.**
  `inspect_sft_packing.py` now hashes every input JSONL and the verifier launcher validates that hash,
  512-token packing length, both correct/incorrect classes, and >=3,000 packed sequences before acquiring
  an SFT GPU. Local and Newton regression tests passed. This makes the running `686536 -> 686540 ->
  686541` rollout/data/packing chain a real capacity gate rather than a report to be manually remembered.
- **2026-07-12 ~14:35** — **Verifier family coverage repaired before data freeze.** Read-only diversity
  inspection showed the supposedly 10k/28-family rollout source actually contains 11,200 family-sorted
  rows; `N=10000` would omit the final three families. Added and tested deterministic `--skip` support to
  the generator plus multi-file global dedup to verifier construction. Active `686536` continues as the
  25-family prefix control; only `686564` tail (skip 10k/take 1.2k) + `686565` merged data + `686566`
  packing can feed verifier SFT. The old pending `686540`/`686541` were canceled before any work began.
- **2026-07-12 ~14:42** — **Verifier-bank prefix bias eliminated for future refreshes.** The root cause
  was `sample_verifier_bank.py` emitting balanced per-family reservoirs in sorted-family order. It now
  applies the existing seeded RNG to the completed bank, with a deterministic regression test. Existing
  11.2k data remains immutable, so the active tail repair stays required; every future bounded rollout
  from a new bank will be representative instead of a family prefix.
- **2026-07-12 ~14:50** — **Fresh composition interview confirms a capability, not formatting, failure.**
  Direct local-MPS interaction with preserved raw 170k ran eight newly worded cases through initial,
  review, verified-fact, requested-state, and state-reuse turns. The hash-recorded transcript is
  `artifacts/eval_history/generalization_interview_raw170k_20260712_mps.json` (md5
  `d9ad30fad6c00958ad9d6908ca14c38a`): **1/8 initial, 0/8 review, 1/8 fact, 0/8 valid state lines,
  and 0/8 valid-state-and-reuse**. The product/reject case calculates 17x23 as 351, the base-7 case
  uses decimal-style powers, and both Python contracts fail execution. Added isolated
  `train/jobs/generalization_interview.sbatch` so the named 180k checkpoint can receive the same
  current-H100 audit without touching the flagship. This prohibits any claim of latent compaction or
  general reasoning from raw pretraining alone.
- **2026-07-12 ~15:05** — **Pretraining quality now has a proper measurement hook.** Added tested
  `train/eval_nll.py` and `train/jobs/eval_nll.sbatch`: fixed named monitor JSONLs are packed exactly
  like next-token pretraining and evaluated as pure token-weighted cross entropy/perplexity, excluding
  `zloss`. Four local tests cover input parsing, deterministic packing, bad-row rejection, and the
  auxiliary-loss exclusion. The monitor is deliberately separate from task evals/training shards; a
  reviewed frozen monitor source is required before a first H100 run. This closes the former gap where
  a healthy mixed training loss was the only pretraining-quality telemetry.
- **2026-07-12 ~15:18** — **First fixed language monitor and baseline are preserved.** CPU job `686575`
  froze WikiText-103 test outside both shard paths and `artifacts/evals`: 1,723 docs / 301,241 tokens,
  monitor SHA-256 `fbe8687d618550d2251b397d436abb30a990d5f0b4e7c25cfe85c7265aa251d8`. Hash-bound MPS
  evaluation of raw `best_step170000.pt` scored NLL 3.9648849 / PPL 52.7142 over 301,056 next-token
  targets; the local/Newton result md5 is `fa9f0ea310287d710d9300c8cb0781ab`. It is a fixed language
  trend baseline only, not a general-reasoning score. Four spare-node H100 attempts failed CUDA tensor
  allocation preflight or were canceled before writing results; no empty result was retained.
- **2026-07-12 ~15:25** — **TACO duplicate and dependency fault repaired before admission.** The
  non-admissible source-order 3k control `686552` selected 3,000 execution-passing candidates but failed
  the generic audit on 11 normalized duplicate questions. Its completed JSONL/report were preserved under
  `artifacts/sft/rejected/`, not deleted or admitted. `curate_taco_verified.py` now drops duplicate
  normalized prompts using the quality auditor's exact identity and reports the drop count. Canceled only
  the dependency-blocked never-started jobs, then rebuilt the clean shuffled chain as
  `686583 -> 686584 -> 686585 -> 686586` with explicit fresh r2 paths. The flagship remains untouched.
- **2026-07-12 ~15:45** — **Held-out code likelihood is useful telemetry, not a causal conclusion.**
  CPU job `686595` froze a CodeContests **test**-split monitor: 122 unique syntactically
  valid Python-3 problem+solution rows / 146,896 tokens, zero benchmark prompt overlaps, input SHA-256
  `62668905552c89650c0dcd79227a6fe606e107c39a126f7c1b5d9364ee8fc687`. Raw 170k MPS scores NLL
  1.3537146 / PPL 3.8718 over 145,408 targets (local/Newton artifact md5
  `8b52525e46958ac20a1d6973b6de0cc0`), while English monitor PPL is 52.7142. The source remains
  directional because raw `code_python` is CodeParrot-Clean and no source-level overlap audit has yet
  ruled out CodeContests-derived code. Future code work must still be execution-verified
  continuation/instruction training and transfer-gated; NLL alone cannot explain HumanEval/MBPP failure.
- **2026-07-12** — **Long all-test TACO audits are now explicitly recoverable without weakening admission.**
  The 250-row full replay took 33 minutes, making a 3,000-row audit vulnerable to an ordinary wall-time
  cutoff. `audit_taco_verified.py --resume-partial` and its wrapper's `RESUME_PARTIAL=1` now resume only
  a prior partial whose every retained row has a matching immutable candidate ID, byte-identical response,
  and positive `full_verified_cases`; malformed, duplicate, altered, or foreign rows abort the retry.
  Focused local/Newton tests passed. This is a recovery path only: `686584` continues unchanged and no
  partial output can enter a candidate or SFT mix.
- **2026-07-12** — **V8 broad-transfer SFT is blocked on fresh hash-bound reports, not trusted by name.**
  The 699,928-row V8 candidate has zero recorded prompt overlap and a moderate 2.75x code replay factor,
  but its earlier quality/packing reports predated input-hash binding. A dry launcher correctly refused it
  before CUDA allocation. `audit_sft_quality.py` now records `data_sha256`; CPU jobs **`686602`** and
  **`686603`** respectively rebuild V8's quality and 2,048-token packing reports without touching its JSONL.
  The new isolated `sft_v8_pilot.sbatch` requires both report hashes to match the exact JSONL, >=600k clean
  rows, >=70k packed sequences, >=2,500 code sequences, all four groups, zero eval overlap, and <=3x replay
  before it can train from a preserved checkpoint. After success it still needs public-board and direct
  composition-transfer gates; it is not a flagship promotion.
- **2026-07-12** — **V8 input gate is now ready for a measured 180k experiment.** CPU quality `686602`
  and packing `686603` completed read-only against the immutable 699,928-row JSONL. Their refreshed
  `quality.r3.json` and `packing.r3.json` both bind the same SHA-256
  `da94f9f6aae1d69a12633241b3971f6cfc68f7a7edbc788b956063ec5a70fc72`; V8 has 73,273 packed
  2,048-token sequences, 2,660 code sequences, zero recorded direct eval overlap, and max replay 2.755x.
  The V8 launcher passed every data gate in a no-GPU dry run and stopped only at CUDA allocation. It is held
  until `best_step180000.pt` is preserved and the known-good `evc25` verifier allocation is free, then must
  run one isolated epoch followed by public-board and direct-composition evaluations. It remains an experiment,
  never a live-pretrain change or promotion by construction.
- **2026-07-12** — **TACO durability observation and fix.** The active pre-fix audit `686584` reached
  100/3,000 all-test-verified matches after its streaming source initialization, but its open `.partial`
  file was still at byte zero because Python had not flushed its text buffer; this is not counted as durable
  output and the job was not disturbed. Future audit code now flushes and `fsync`s every logged progress
  batch before printing it, so an explicit resume can retain verified rows after a wall-time interruption.
  Focused local tests pass and the fix is mirrored to Newton for a retry only.
- **2026-07-12** — **V8 direct-transfer interview now has its own data-leakage gate.** Public benchmark
  filtering does not establish that the custom eight-case composition interview is held out. New tested
  `audit_generalization_overlap.py` parses the evaluator's literal `CASES` through AST, then records exact
  and 13-gram prompt overlap plus SHA-256s for both the candidate JSONL and interview source. CPU job
  **`686625`** is read-only, excludes the active TACO node `evc21`, and must report zero overlap before
  V8's launcher can proceed. The launcher now requires that report to bind the exact frozen data and current
  interview source before CUDA allocation; lexical disjointness is necessary evidence for transfer, not a
  sufficient general-reasoning claim.
- **2026-07-12** — **V8 passes the direct-interview lexical holdout gate.** CPU job `686625` completed
  off the active TACO node with **699,928 valid rows**, no malformed/missing prompts, and **0 exact / 0
  13-gram** hits against all eight current composition-interview prompts. The report binds V8 data SHA-256
  `da94f9f6aae1d69a12633241b3971f6cfc68f7a7edbc788b956063ec5a70fc72` and case-source SHA-256
  `6820a1d77e206ffd92dff837fb38c5c0633d06788aabbab3ade9ef0bafc2c3be`. V8 is now admissible solely as
  an isolated 180k pre/post transfer experiment after the raw baseline, public board, and transcript gates
  are serialized on a known-good H100.
- **2026-07-12** — **Full TACO replay retry can now use the allocated CPUs without weakening tests.** The
  active `686584` process is healthy but runs full supplied cases through one subprocess worker despite its
  two-core allocation, so it remains untouched as the baseline outcome. The retry-only audit now first maps
  every selected immutable source ID, then executes each complete test suite through a bounded
  `ThreadPoolExecutor`; `WORKERS=2` uses no more than the existing two-core Slurm request and preserves
  deterministic source order, the same 2s sandbox timeout, every supplied case, partial-row integrity, and
  fsynced progress batches. Local and Newton real-execution tests passed. Use this only if `686584` ends
  non-successfully; override a resubmission to `WORKERS=2` and a sufficient wall-time, never relax tests.
- **2026-07-12** — **Raw-to-V8 transfer chain is queued, serial, and isolated.** On the known-good H100
  node `evc25`, after the verifier-tail job `686564` succeeds and after `best_step180000.pt` should exist,
  queued jobs are: **`686638`** raw-180k public board -> **`686639`** raw-180k composition interview ->
  **`686640`** one-epoch hash/overlap-gated V8 SFT -> **`686641`** V8 public board -> **`686642`** V8
  composition interview. The direct interviews preserve full transcripts; V8 cannot start unless the raw
  interview succeeds, and V8 cannot be promoted from a constructed/held-out generator score alone. This
  chain has no flagship output path and cannot run before the current verifier H100 work ends.
- **2026-07-12** — **Fresh bounded GLM health probe remains negative.** One isolated train-only ARC
  request to NVIDIA `z-ai/glm-5.2` with 20s timeout/one worker completed in 35s with `attempted=1`,
  `kept=0`, `wrong=0`, and `err=1`; its scratch output is empty. It did not touch a live writer or any
  frozen mix. Keep GLM, Nemotron, and HY3 bulk paused rather than spending requests in an error loop; GLM
  remains the first teacher to re-enable only after a later bounded probe has a real verified keep.
- **2026-07-12** — **Tokenizer coverage audit found no fallback defect.** Read-only held-out encodes with
  `shohin-tok-32k.json` found **0** `<unk>` or byte-fallback pieces: WikiText-103 test is 4.12 characters
  per token / 1.30 tokens per word, CodeContests test prompt+Python is 2.87 / 2.08, MATH-500 prompts are
  2.67 / 2.33, and GSM8K prompts are 3.78 / 1.37. The denser math/code segmentation is expected from
  notation and punctuation; this rules out a gross coverage failure but does **not** prove the frozen 32k
  tokenizer is never a capability constraint. No tokenizer change is justified mid-pretrain.
- **2026-07-12** — **V8 promotion rule is precommitted and machine-checked.** CPU decision job **`686643`**
  follows the raw/V8 transcript chain and writes only a verdict report. `accept_followup` requires all five
  deterministic public metrics, improvements on at least two, no HumanEval/MBPP regression, an eight-case
  direct interview with initial-answer gain, and no verified-fact regression; constructed holdout scores,
  formatting, and state-marker emission alone are explicitly insufficient. Any missing evaluator artifact or
  failed condition rejects V8. `evaluate_v8_promotion.py` passed both an accept fixture and a code-regression
  rejection fixture locally and on Newton. Even acceptance is only a follow-up decision, never a flagship
  promotion.
- **2026-07-12 ~15:42** — **Three external NVIDIA reasoning sources are in read-only intake, not data
  admission.** New tested `probe_reasoning_source.py` records dataset config/split, builder license metadata,
  field shapes and lengths, plus sampled exact and 13-gram overlap against every live eval JSONL without
  retaining source rows or executing code. CPU-only jobs **`686647`** (`nvidia/OpenMathReasoning`),
  **`686648`** (`nvidia/OpenScienceReasoning-2`), and **`686649`** (`nvidia/OpenCodeReasoning-2`) write only
  immutable reports under `artifacts/source_probes/`. A source remains inspection-only until its report,
  license/provenance, field mapping, split policy, and a source-specific decontamination/quality plan are
  reviewed; no bulk download, frozen-mix change, or flagship change is authorized by these probes.
- **2026-07-12 ~15:45** — **Initial source inspection found real admission constraints.** The first
  `train`-split requests for OpenMath and OpenCode stopped safely after discovering their actual split layouts;
  explicit read-only probes now cover OpenMath `cot` / `tir` / `genselect` and OpenCode `python` / `cpp`.
  The 64-row results find one OpenMath `cot` **generated-solution** 13-gram hit against live eval prompts
  (no exact hit), so that split is contamination-sensitive and cannot be used without full-stream filtering.
  OpenMath `cot`/`tir` generated solutions have roughly 16k/19k median characters, OpenScience outputs
  roughly 14k, and OpenCode `r1_generation` roughly 19k (Python) / 46k (C++): raw traces are materially too
  long for the 2,048-token SFT context and must not be replayed naively. All r1 reports are local/Newton
  hash-matched; card-hashing r2 probes `686655`/`686656`/`686657` are inspection-only and must establish
  license provenance before a source-specific field mapping or curator is proposed.
- **2026-07-12 ~15:55** — **V8 now has a full training-text decontamination proof, not only a
  prompt-only audit.** CPU job **`686662`** scanned every `question`, `response`, and `completion_prompt`
  string in all **699,928** frozen V8 rows against every current eval JSONL: **0 exact rows, 0 13-gram rows,
  0 malformed JSON rows**. Its data SHA-256 is the same frozen V8 value
  `da94f9f6aae1d69a12633241b3971f6cfc68f7a7edbc788b956063ec5a70fc72`. The held V8 SFT job now depends
  on this successful audit and its launcher independently requires the hash-bound zero-overlap report.
  This establishes decontamination, not quality transfer or a promotion claim.
- **2026-07-12 ~15:55** — **TACO now has an automatic non-success failover without duplicating a
  successful path.** The original all-test audit and its `686585 -> 686586` candidate/packing chain remain
  unchanged. Only if `686584` ends non-successfully, `686659` runs a fresh-output retry from the immutable
  shuffled input with `RESUME_PARTIAL=1`, 2 workers, every supplied test, and a 3-day wall-time; then
  `686660 -> 686661` builds and packs a separately named candidate. This prevents a wall-time loss from
  becoming a silent data-quality relaxation or a manual recovery gap.
- **2026-07-12 ~15:55** — **NVIDIA source cards are license-confirmed but remain unadmitted.** Hash-bound
  r2 card probes identify **CC-BY-4.0** for OpenMathReasoning, OpenScienceReasoning-2, and
  OpenCodeReasoning-2. OpenMath COT still has one sampled response 13-gram collision, every source has
  long raw traces, and OpenCode's apparent `question` field is not yet a usable prompt mapping. CPU-only
  `686664` is measuring the actual 50k-row OpenMath COT yield after concise-token limits, final-answer
  verification, and full problem+trace decontamination. It writes only a report; no candidate is authorized
  unless this measured yield and source-specific semantics justify one.
- **2026-07-12 ~16:10** — **OpenMath COT selection is a real data-quality constraint, not a source-scale
  shortcut.** The source card says `used_in_kaggle` means a row trained NVIDIA's AIMO-2-winning model, not
  that it is an evaluation sample. Our own full problem+trace eval filtering is therefore the relevant
  leakage control; the selector now records this flag as provenance instead of dropping it by default. The
  initially over-conservative 10k / 2,048-token COT dry run kept only **30** rows: 6,765 were unnecessarily
  excluded by that provenance flag, 3,151 exceeded the context cap, 35 failed final-answer verification, and
  11 had direct eval 13-gram hits. It proves raw long-CoT replay is inadmissible. The obsolete zero-yield
  512-token probe was stopped; corrected all-provenance 10k probe `686671` retains strict answer and
  full-text decontamination and must determine whether enough concise verified rows exist before a candidate
  build is considered.
- **2026-07-12 ~16:17** — **180k is preserved and the metrics ledger is now a required custody artifact.**
  `685084` reached step **180,000** at loss **1.6526**, gnorm **0.103**, and **154.30k tok/s**; the sole
  180,030 gnorm guard skip recovered immediately. Numbered `ckpt_0180000.pt`, Newton
  `best_step180000.pt`, and local `train/flagship_out/ckpt_0180000.pt` are full optimizer checkpoints with
  matching md5 **`a592a8bd46163eb1427fe64460be0c6a`**. New `TRAINING_METRICS.md` records the exact distinction
  between **94,371,840,000 nominal update tokens** at 180k and the current **57,826,022,271-token** active
  corpus capacity, plus checkpoint inventory, data-admission status, benchmark baselines, and the update
  protocol. It must be refreshed at every 10k milestone from manifests/reports/logs only; partial data is
  never counted as admitted.
- **2026-07-12 ~16:17** — **The OpenMath COT exact-context selection result is inspection evidence, not
  admission.** New combined prompt+completion+EOS accounting matches `sft.py`'s separate encodes. Under the
  exact 2,048-token limit, all-provenance `686672` kept **326/10,000** rows after final-answer verification
  and full problem+trace evaluation decontamination; 9,398 traces were individually long and 17 additional
  examples exceeded the true combined limit. The apparent source scale is therefore not usable training
  volume without an explicit candidate, packing, balance, and quality review.
- **2026-07-12 ~17:14** — **Fresh direct interaction at raw 180k remains negative.** The preserved local
  180k checkpoint was queried through the seven-case `manual_capability_probe.py` suite with greedy,
  bounded 32-token completions: **1/7 initial, 0/7 review, 1/7 verified fact, 0/7 state reuse**. Only the
  simple syllogism was correct; it still treats base-6 as decimal division, ignores supplied arithmetic
  state, emits unrelated solution/code text for sort/string tasks, and fails the Python predicate contract.
  The shorter cap makes this directional rather than a formal 128-token comparison, but there is no visible
  reasoning improvement. Artifact `artifacts/eval_history/manual_capability_raw180k_20260712_mps32.json`,
  md5 **`cc6332a5c99d6cbf6ba2f8987ae58cc0`**, is local/Newton hash-matched and must remain diagnostic-only.
- **2026-07-12 ~17:14** — **Checkpoint retention accounting corrected.** `ckpt_0180000.pt` existed and
  matched its promoted copy at the 180k milestone, then the trainer reaped the numbered file by its normal
  retention policy. Durable copies are Newton `best_step180000.pt` and local full
  `train/flagship_out/ckpt_0180000.pt`, both md5 **`a592a8bd46163eb1427fe64460be0c6a`**. The metrics ledger
  now records this distinction explicitly rather than claiming a numbered file remains indefinitely.
- **2026-07-12 ~18:02** — **VRWM context-scaling research has a hard raw baseline and an admissible,
  isolated data candidate.** The new Verified Recursive Working Memory controller forwards a model-emitted
  canonical `wm:a=<int>;b=<int>` state to one later instruction without correction, answer injection, or
  best-of-N selection; it therefore tests an actual closed-loop transition policy rather than V7-style
  state-format imitation. Raw `best_step180000.pt` scored **0/25** exact first transitions and **0/25**
  closed-loop rollouts across five prompt-disjoint value/length OOD regimes (five episodes each). Candidate
  r1 was rejected for 166,766 duplicate normalized prompts; r2 passed quality but was too small at 2,263
  packs; r3 has **497,274** unique rows, zero malformed/duplicate/full-text-eval overlaps, and **18,013**
  packed 2,048-token sequences (SHA-256 `b2a688e1f7aa6c79dd65ed1944fa5dc00cd022acfc793896ecf4696c94d4089f`).
  It is hash-matched locally/Newton and staged only. Do not submit its SFT until a known-good CUDA node is
  available; opportunistic `evc26`, `evc43`, and `evc50` allocations all failed CUDA preflight before model
  loading and wrote no misleading score. Full research contract: `VRWM_RESEARCH.md`.
- **2026-07-12 ~18:13** — **Two-H100 training is re-authorized only at a natural handoff.** User explicitly
  permitted two GPUs for faster training. `685084` remains untouched on evc22 through 182,120 at 154.31k
  tok/s. A fresh BS32/ACC4 DDP validation attempt `686728` reached evc31 but both rank-1 attempts failed
  before model loading with CUDA "busy or unavailable," so it produced no loss/capability result and was
  canceled. Synced the forward-only `train.py` stream-generation fix to Newton (it cannot alter the loaded
  flagship process), hardened `flagship2.sbatch` so auto-recovery preserves BS32/ACC4/250-checkpoint
  parameters and a supplied static CUDA blacklist, and submitted **`686732` afterany:`685084`**. It requests
  two H100s/four CPUs, preserves the 524,288-token update, uses fresh optimizer rewarmup, excludes
  `evc26,31,36,43,50`, and remains dependency-held until the single writer exits. Scheduler test selected
  evc37. On start, verify actual CUDA/DDP health before treating it as a throughput or capability gain.
- **2026-07-12 ~18:31** — **Current-code two-H100 handoff is revalidated.** Isolated job `686734` ran on
  evc37 from the durable 180k checkpoint: both GPUs were visible, `world=2`, `BS=32`, `ACC=4`, fresh
  optimizer, and new `stream_generation=1` all printed before training. It completed the bounded 320-step
  run exit 0 with no CUDA/NCCL/DDP error. Compile-free late windows were 291.7-293.9k tok/s (~1.90x the
  154.3k tok/s one-H100 flagship); compile-inclusive final rate was 243.8k tok/s. Loss/gnorm stayed in band;
  the guard skipped the final step 180,319 at gnorm 1.71 vs 0.09 EMA, so the short run cannot prove its
  recovery but does not contaminate any flagship state. Retain `686732` as the verified natural successor;
  it must still prove a recovered post-skip live trajectory after its real handoff.
- **2026-07-12 ~20:31** — **VRWM r3/r4 results and the r5 repair gate are now explicit.** r3 SFT
  `686742` completed one epoch from `best_step180000.pt`; full default p80 closed-loop result is
  **43/400**, but held-out paraphrase p10 is **0/50**, rejecting any semantic-transfer claim. The larger
  r4 data branches each have 513,902 audited rows: state-only r4 is **32/400 default / 2/400 semantic**;
  deterministic scratch r4 is **120/400 default / 21/400 semantic**. Scratch therefore improves a
  controlled executable-state task, including 12/80 length-16 and 3/80 length-32 default programs, but
  it remains weak under held-out language and is not a reasoning promotion. Repair curriculum r5 has
  1,409,072 audited rows (68,347 packed sequences; data SHA-256
  `011282f032963a40b8b39ab9572808de1d3473ef2b57ef727526fb9d00985c76`), with correct and plausible-wrong
  model-state proposals per transition. Isolated SFT `686820` began cleanly on evc37. Four fresh reports
  are chained: default first-pass `686827`, semantic first-pass `686828`, then same-model repair default
  `686829` and semantic `686830`. The controller only transports the model's draft/repair output; it never
  executes, selects, or repairs a state itself. This is the discriminating gate before considering any
  further context-scaling work.
- **2026-07-12 ~21:07** — **Direct operator interaction rejected r5 for broad capability before its
  narrow repair chain completes.** r5 SFT `686820` completed one epoch in **1,303s** and its 500,446,874-byte
  `sft_ep1.pt` is md5 **`ef99f8c2ab5835c8229bcd4f36fb8789`** on Newton and the Mac. The first two r5
  p80 evaluations initially failed on evc26/evc31 at CUDA preflight before loading a model, so those jobs
  are hardware non-results; downstream dependencies were canceled. The resubmitted semantic first-pass
  result is **17/400** (r4 scratch semantic was 21/400), while default and repair measurements continue
  only to characterize the constructed protocol. Crucially, a fresh eight-case human-style transcript
  interview directly compared raw 180k with r5. Raw is **1/8 initial, 0/8 review, 1/8 supplied fact,
  0/8 state/reuse**; r5 is **0/8 on every condition** and emits synthetic `check:` / `wm:` text for ordinary
  product, base conversion, logic, list, string, and Python questions, even when given a correct fact.
  This is answer-format collapse from an overly narrow curriculum, not thinking. Do not use r5 for broad
  benchmarks or as a promoted model. Preserve the transcripts and finish the model-only repair control for
  diagnosis, then reject the branch unless it motivates a strictly bounded future data-mixing ablation.
- **2026-07-12 ~22:00** — **V9's low-share memory hypothesis now has an immutable response-contract
  proof.** New read-only `audit_response_contracts.py` and focused tests bind each candidate's exact
  SHA-256 to response markers, state markers, trace starts, and length distribution by training group.
  V8 (`da94f9f6...`) has procedural `<think>` starts in 100% of its 374,659 rows; V9 (`8f5845d1...`)
  adds 513,902 compact scratch-state rows but samples them at only 5%. Its report confirms 82.57% state
  markers only within the VRWM group, while the four broad groups retain their original contracts; report
  md5 is `934fa1471fa41476ed9e6c0fa2364177`. The V9 launcher now requires this hash-bound report plus
  its existing quality, complete training-text decontamination, exact packing, and replay checks before a
  rerun can allocate CUDA. The already-running `686876` remains untouched and has passed the same gate
  in dry validation; current optimization is stable but **not** capability evidence. The raw pinned board
  `686861` continues before V8. No broad promotion can be made until V8/V9 boards, fresh direct
  transcripts, and V9 semantic-memory evaluation all complete.
- **2026-07-12 ~22:25** — **A final answer is no longer sufficient evidence that Shohin is thinking.**
  New `thinking_trace_audit.py` has twelve fixed held-out arithmetic, state-transition, base-conversion,
  and trace-repair questions. Each requires a model-generated `<think>` block with a correct hidden
  intermediate marker (for example `product=378` or `after_multiply=75`) **and** a correct explicit final
  answer; either element alone receives no visible-reasoning credit. Focused parser tests pass. The case
  source is lexically disjoint at exact and 13-gram levels from all 699,928 V8 and 1,213,830 V9 prompts.
  Raw baseline `686935`, V8 candidate `686936`, and V9 candidate `686937` are isolated H100 transcript
  jobs. Stale pending V8/V9 decision-only jobs were canceled before execution and replaced by `686938` and
  `686939`, which cannot run until their respective board, eight-case direct interview, visible-trace, and
  (for V9) default+semantic memory artifacts all succeed. This raises the promotion bar; it does not change
  any model weights, live data stream, or flagship job.
- **2026-07-12 ~22:35** — **V9 evaluation was unblocked from an unrelated V8 serialization without
  weakening any gate.** V8 and V9 are separate one-epoch SFTs from the same immutable 180k base; waiting
  for V8's much longer raw-board/SFT path gave no additional V9 evidence. H100 capacity is available and
  the user authorized bounded parallel research. Pending-only `686881`-`686885`, `686937`, and `686939`
  were canceled before execution or artifact creation. Replacement `686942` (board) and `686943`
  (interview) depend only on successful V9 SFT `686876`; `686944`/`686945` then run default/semantic VRWM
  p80, `686946` runs the held-out visible-thinking transcript, and `686947` waits for every one of those
  outputs plus raw trace `686935`. This is a speed improvement only: no checkpoint, data file, evaluator
  rule, or flagship process changed.
- **2026-07-12 ~22:40** — **Direct raw-180k visible-thinking baseline is 0/12.** The preserved local
  optimizer checkpoint was queried through all twelve fresh trace questions on MPS with greedy 96-token
  decoding. It emitted no `<think>` blocks, no correct required intermediates, and no correct final answers.
  Its first product answer became `27 x 14 = 498`, then recursively `498 x 14 = 7768`; a sequential task
  used the wrong precedence, base conversion stopped at `356 = 300 + 50 + 6`, and correction repeated the
  supplied bad arithmetic. The transcript is saved locally and on Newton as
  `thinking_trace_raw180k_mps_20260712.json`, md5 `5eb7fa94cea87cc138416801f593f85c`. This is a direct
  behavioral diagnosis, not an aggregate score: raw Shohin does not yet produce usable visible reasoning.
  H100 raw trace `686935` remains required for matched candidate promotion decisions.
- **2026-07-12 ~23:20** — **V9 broad-plus-memory pilot is mixed evidence, not a reasoning promotion.**
  Its one-epoch checkpoint is complete and hash-matched locally/Newton. The in-progress H100 board has
  already raised GSM8K from raw 1.0% maj@8 / 3.5% pass@1 to 9.0% / 10.5%, but the independently completed
  eight-case interaction is only 1/8 initial, 0/8 review, 1/8 verified-fact, and 0 valid state/reuse.
  Corrected special-token transcript decoding reveals `<think>` tags on 9/12 cases but no correct
  intermediate, final, or trace-and-final result. Keep all remaining V9 gates running and reject it if
  that direct/trace failure persists, regardless of partial board movement.
- **2026-07-12 ~23:20** — **Semantic bridge is data-gated before model training.** Generated 200k
  solver-verified train plus 5k held-out cases across five natural-language arithmetic/state/repair
  families. Admission audit passed zero malformed/duplicate/eval-overlap rows; V10's 899,928-row broad
  plus 10% bridge candidate is now in its exact packing gate. Added `eval_semantic_bridge.py` with a
  deterministic, per-family held-out subset and separate answer/trace metrics. No V10 SFT may be launched
  until that mix finishes its gate and the future checkpoint can be measured on this evaluator as well as
  the public board and direct transcripts.
- **2026-07-12 ~23:25** — **V10 frozen bridge mix admitted, still not trained.** Job `686966` completed
  its final exact-packing and replay gate at 899,928 rows / 81,705 packs. No malformed rows, duplicate
  normalized questions, or exact/13-gram held-out overlap survived; code and teacher replay remain below
  the 3x ceiling and bridge replay is 0.97x. This makes the data suitable for an isolated ablation after
  V9 completes, not a basis to claim capability before the held-out semantic, direct-transcript, and
  public evaluations run.
- **2026-07-12 ~23:45** — **Semantic capsule context control queued, without touching training.** New
  generator/evaluator data separates semantic fact preservation from V7's fixed-answer state templates:
  a model must create a two-field capsule from a natural record, update it across context resets using
  model-generated states only, and answer a final read/sum/difference query after the source record is
  gone. Held-out domains, fields, wording, values, and 4/8/12-step lengths are disjoint. `686991` builds
  the CPU-only data and `686992` independently recomputes every transition/query plus all train-to-heldout
  controller-prompt exact/13-gram overlap. It is a diagnostic candidate, not an SFT decision.
- **2026-07-13 ~00:20** — **The raw model remains healthy; untrained recurrence is rejected.** Flagship
  `685084` reached observed step **187,870** at **154.31k tok/s** with recent loss/gnorm in band; it was
  not interrupted. The two-H100 successor remains dependency-held for the natural handoff. Matched
  180k inference-loop probe `687004` completed: loop 1 scored Q/A **5/24** and CoT **0/24**, whereas
  loop 2 scored **0/24** in both modes and its eight-case direct interview fell from raw's 1/8 initial
  and verified-fact results to 0/8. This is a negative architecture control, not a model regression:
  untrained extra recurrence is not a reasoning shortcut and will not enter the flagship.
- **2026-07-13 ~00:20** — **V9's partial math-format lift does not survive broad gates.** Its continuing
  board has GSM8K maj@8 **18/200** and pass@1 **21/200** against raw 2/200 and 7/200, but MATH-500 is
  unchanged at **5/200** and HumanEval is **5/164**, below raw's 7/164. Combined with 1/8 direct
  interaction and 0/12 correct visible traces, V9 is already ineligible for broad promotion; the
  remaining MBPP/memory/decision chain is retained for a complete controlled record rather than used to
  rationalize a cherry-picked score.
- **2026-07-13 ~00:20** — **Corrected semantic-capsule protocol passed its first independent gate.**
  Build `687009` produced 360,000 train rows and 3,000 held-out 4/8/12-step episodes. Protocol audit
  `687010` recomputed every transition/query and checked every held-out controller prompt: 0 malformed
  or duplicate train rows, 0 invalid episodes, and 0 exact or 13-gram train/held-out overlaps across
  30,000 controller prompts. Generic data admission `687013` now runs quality, full-text,
  response-contract, and 2,048-token packing gates before any raw or SFT model evaluation can be queued.
- **2026-07-13 ~00:25** — **Semantic-capsule generic admission was tightened to measured capacity, not
  relaxed around a quality failure.** Read-only run `687013` measured 360,000 clean rows, 46,898,373
  tokens, 22,899 exact 2,048-token packs, and zero generic prompt/full-text eval overlaps before stopping
  only because its predeclared 25,000-pack capacity floor was too high. The corpus remains sufficient for
  a low-share mixed ablation, so the floor is now an explicit 20,000 packs and rerun `687015` uses fresh
  report paths. No data file, checkpoint, SFT job, or flagship process was modified.
- **2026-07-13 ~00:30** — **Closed-loop context baselines are held behind admission.** `687015` passed
  every generic data gate at 360,000 rows and 22,899 exact packs. First raw job `687017` failed CUDA
  preflight on `evc26` before model load, so it is a hardware non-result and its held V9 successor
  `687018` was canceled. Replacement `687019` evaluates immutable raw 180k over 100 held-out episodes
  per 4/8/12-step regime on the vetted-node exclude set; only if it is complete and clean does `687020`
  evaluate the isolated V9 checkpoint on identical episodes. The evaluator carries only model-emitted
  capsules, never executes or repairs a state, and records every response. These jobs cannot train or
  promote a model; they establish the raw/V9 floor before any semantic-capsule SFT mix is considered.
- **2026-07-13 ~00:40** — **Model-generated semantic capsules fail for raw and V9.** Raw `687019` and
  V9 `687020` both completed all 300 held-out 4/8/12-step episodes with **0 closed-loop successes**, 0
  valid initial capsules, and 0 correct transitions. This is strong negative evidence against treating
  state-marker formatting or V9's GSM8K lift as semantic memory. The capsule route is rejected for
  promotion and remains only a documented control.
- **2026-07-13 ~00:40** — **V8 also fails behavioral reasoning gates.** Refreshed isolated V8 SFT
  `687003` completed its one epoch (4,580 updates / 1,496s), but fresh direct `687033` was **0/8 initial**
  and fresh visible trace `687034` was **0/12** correct intermediate/final pairs. Its board `687032`
  remains read-only evidence only; no board outcome can override those transfer failures. A direct
  raw-versus-V8 interactive transcript audit `687043` was queued separately for qualitative review.
- **2026-07-13 ~00:40** — **Continuous latent feedback is now a controlled, paired experiment rather
  than another text-state recipe.** Commit `318c6b9` adds the isolated `forward_embeds`/soft-token
  rollout, answer-only curriculum trainer, held-out depth evaluator, CPU generation/admission jobs, and
  tensor/gradient/pairing tests. The first 96k generator `687038` was stopped by its solver audit before
  admission due to **2,608 duplicate normalized prompts**; its train, held-out, and audit files were
  preserved in `artifacts/rejected/`, and blocked admission `687039` was canceled. Commit `98ee9a2`
  fixes uniqueness at generation time and passed a full 96k-row stress test in 2.18s. Rebuild `687041`
  followed by admission `687042` is queued. No latent/control H100 training can start before the fresh
  audit passes.
- **2026-07-13 ~00:50** — **Corrected continuous-latent data is admitted and paired pilots are live.**
  CPU build `687041` plus generic admission `687042` passed at **96,000** unique train rows and **1,800**
  held-out depth-5/6/8 rows; training SHA-256 is
  `aa65eefd1dbee25c3c7cec956059a970ea53e079bbc4f4695dd160cacd980fd9`, with zero malformed,
  duplicate, public-eval, full-text, exact, or 13-gram held-out overlap. H100 canary `687046` ran 32
  exact-shape batches through L=0/1/2/4, saved its isolated checkpoint, and remained finite; its first
  run `687044` was preserved after discovering a prefix-only cap gave no full token-shape batch. Commit
  `72e8ca6` now selects complete batches from the frozen full corpus. Matched `24,000`-example one-epoch
  pilots `687048` (L=0 control) and `687049` (progressive L=4) run from the same raw 180k checkpoint,
  data SHA, seed, batch size, optimizer, and update count. Their separate held-out evaluators
  `687050`/`687051` test rollout depths 0/1/2/4/8 only after successful checkpoints; nothing in this
  chain can alter flagship pretraining.
- **2026-07-13 ~00:45** — **The matched continuous-feedback pilot is rejected by the
  factorized transfer gate.** Control `687048` and progressive-L4 `687049` both completed
  1,500 updates from the same raw-180k checkpoint, frozen 24,000-example selection, seed,
  optimizer, and batch size. The original full-OOD evaluator gives the control and pilot
  **0/600 at every L=0/1/2/4/8**. Its answer parser is valid, not the cause: control replies
  `The answer is <int>.` on all 600 L0 cases but is incorrect. To separate fit from transfer,
  CPU-only `687057` built audited v2 evaluation slices: 896 rows, SHA-256
  `b9106b3233c62592dba5f244d5fdec5474d56c813b6d39dc0fe8ee77a441039`, zero invalid or
  duplicate rows and zero exact train prompts. The matched control v2 result is 50.39% IID,
  14.06% depth-OOD, 13.28% language-OOD, 0.00% full-OOD. The feedback pilot is worse in every
  regime: L0 41.41/6.77/10.94/0.00%, L2 44.92/9.38/11.72/0.00%, L4
  46.48/12.50/11.72/0.00%. Thus low answer-only loss and a few in-template solves do not
  establish latent reasoning, composition, or context scaling. Mark this final-hidden-state
  feedback route rejected; preserve reports/control checkpoint/pilot checkpoint (md5
  `e1c093a51a808c14acb21299fbf8be7b`, `9a516983a4b1cd85bd4bbc96f4f97230`,
  `47abf77baabef759d68c92c6257a9e1c`, `6636e328d382db8b100309742d5bdbda`) as immutable
  negative evidence. New local-only source-dropping fixed-slot memory code and tests are an
  isolated follow-up: every source token must be absent at decoder time and M=0/detached/
  shuffled-memory controls are required before any H100 run. The live flagship was untouched,
  healthy through step 189,060 at 154.31k tok/s; next DR target remains 190k.
- **2026-07-13 ~01:15** — **Source-dropping packet mechanics passed, but its tiny
  capability screen is negative and remains unpromoted.** CPU job `687072` generated an
  admitted 192,000-row train / 1,536-row factorized held-out corpus (train SHA-256
  `419199a756679e61601c05481ffc59221fba75b601608990539781013a51da64`; held-out SHA-256
  `6a10a6b27be8dc6b0a36954296d9f33abd099d87bbdff46c251a1357f1c894c3`) with zero malformed,
  duplicate, or exact train-eval source prompts. Canary `687074` exposed a variable chunk-width
  batching bug before any optimizer step; the wrapper/trainer were patched to preserve each chunk
  as a separate `[batch, tokens]` tensor, and focused dense/ragged/gradient/batching tests passed.
  Fresh canary `687077` then completed 128 updates with finite loss, no CUDA/NCCL/DDP error, and
  checkpoint md5 `a92f973b5fb7a35ee3937a15c4db2bd5`. Its read-only held-out ablation `687079`
  is normal **0/192**, zero-packet **2/192**, shuffled-packet **1/192**: it learned answer format,
  not a transferable retained-state algorithm. This is exactly the expected boundary of a mechanics
  canary, so the next gated evidence is a matched 24,000-example / 6,000-update M0 no-slot control
  `687082` versus M1 eight-slot source-dropping pilot `687083`, both from immutable raw-180k with
  identical selection, seed, optimizer, and schedule. Their after-success evaluators `687084`/
  `687085` score normal, zero, and shuffled packets on an independently held-out balanced screen.
  The flagship stayed untouched and healthy through step 189,480 at 154.32k tok/s.
- **2026-07-13 ~01:32** — **M0 completed; CLL remains an unsubmitted, audited fallback.**
  M0 `687082` completed its exact 6,000-update matched no-slot run in 1,153s and its held-out
  normal/zero/shuffled evaluator `687084` started; M1 `687083` remains independently training and
  must finish before comparator `687088` can decide whether any source-memory claim is justified.
  Local CLL code now provides every-prefix solver-recomputed readbacks, counterfactual final-event
  pairs, independent operation/query replay, and exact/13-gram **input-prompt** split rejection.
  Small and 3,580-row smoke datasets had zero malformed/duplicate/pair/overlap failures; CLL source
  tags remain discarded-source-only, never query/answer tokens. The CPU-only build script is prepared
  but deliberately unsubmitted until the answer-only causal comparison resolves. Flagship `685084`
  stayed isolated and healthy through step 189,880 at 154.31k tok/s; 190k remains the next DR target.
- **2026-07-13 ~01:44** — **190k is durable; M0 is a true no-memory null.** `685084` logged
  190,000 at loss 1.5030 / gnorm 0.09 / 154.31k tok/s, then continued healthy. Numbered
  `ckpt_0190000.pt`, Newton `best_step190000.pt`, and local full+optimizer
  `train/flagship_out/ckpt_0190000.pt` match at md5 `3e195aaf44a14259797c49d7f80d9c7f`.
  M0 evaluator `687084` finished normal/zero/shuffled all **6/384 = 1.5625%**, including zero
  long-context successes. That is the required null control, not memory evidence. The M1 packet
  train remains isolated and stable; comparator `687088` still determines the answer-only route.
  Commit `4eb50c9` adds a future CLL full-held-out evaluator that preserves counterfactual pairs and
  requires a 10-point pairwise normal-packet advantage only when pairs are present; it was not
  synced into the in-flight M1 evaluation to preserve the already-launched experiment definition.
- **2026-07-13 ~01:50** — **Direct raw-190k interaction confirms that the flagship does not yet
  think.** Local-MPS `generalization_interview_raw_190k_local_mps.json` (checkpoint
  `ckpt_0190000.pt`, md5 `9ecff93b6d70f889b1d0fbe4decd4dd8`) scored **1/8 initial**, **0/8 after
  explicit independent review**, and **1/8 with a supplied verified intermediate fact**; the only
  correct case was a simple set constraint. All **8/8** requested compact states failed the exact
  `state=` contract and all reuse attempts failed. Arithmetic, base conversion, sequential state,
  sorting, string manipulation, and two code tasks showed prompt echo, tutorial/code imitation, or
  incorrect computation rather than a recovered procedure. This is behavioral evidence, not a
  benchmark proxy: no broad-reasoning or thinking claim is permitted for raw 190k.
- **2026-07-13 ~02:05** — **Matched answer-only source-packet memory is rejected.** M1 `687083`
  (eight slots) completed its exact 6,000 updates in 2,694s, then independent evaluator `687085`
  scored normal/zero/shuffled **6/384 / 6/384 / 9/384**. Locked comparator `687088` returned
  `advance_answer_only_source_packet=false`: normal lost the IID comparison (**4/96 vs 5/96
  shuffled**) and the combined length/language comparison (**2/192 vs 3/192 control**), with zero
  positive chunk or query-kind margins. The packet has no demonstrated retained-information effect;
  preserve reports as negative evidence and do not scale this recipe. The next bounded mechanism is
  the CPU-only certified latent-ledger data build: solver-recomputed readbacks at each source prefix,
  plus complete final-event counterfactual pairs, before any new H100 experiment is admitted.
- **2026-07-13 ~02:07** — **Certified latent-ledger build is submitted, not yet admitted.** After
  a fresh-path check and `sbatch --test-only` reservation, CPU-only `687132` was submitted with
  `TRAIN_EPISODES=16000` and `EVAL_EPISODES_PER_CHUNK=32`. It may write only
  `certified_latent_ledger_v1_train.jsonl`, `certified_latent_ledger_v1_heldout.jsonl`, and its audit
  report. The generator/auditor and future pair-safe evaluator/comparator hashes were verified on
  Newton before submission. No model checkpoint, SFT mix, flagship data stream, or H100 training job
  is part of this build.
- **2026-07-13 ~02:12** — **Certified latent-ledger data is admitted and matched GPU gates are
  queued.** CPU `687132` completed in 153s with **223,996** train rows, **7,936** held-out rows,
  **16,000** train counterfactual pairs, and **384** held-out pairs. Independent audit has zero
  invalid rows, duplicate prompts, exact overlaps, 13-gram overlaps, or malformed pairs; train/eval
  SHA-256 are `1fd39b2ece45c47dd48015489221c1998adb463302097cf21b3dd5345ef3a515` and
  `1bef01c34bf034aaf00a8f976b4463cc28af87ca460c8187873543a7e05ad6a9`. Trainer commit `5457a8f`
  now refuses a CLL audit lacking valid nonzero pairs. Matched raw-190k M0 slots=0 `687134` and M1
  slots=8 `687135` use the same 24,000 selected examples / 6,000 updates / seed / optimizer, followed
  by pair-safe evaluators `687136/687137` and locked comparator `687138`. Every GPU job excludes
  live-node `evc22`; no job can modify the flagship.

- **2026-07-13 current custody check** — **CLL v1 is preserved as a correctness pass, but H100
  trials were stopped before start by an efficiency preflight.** Read-only tokenization of 20,000 v1
  train rows found mean/p50/p95 chunk lengths **213.36/208/241** tokens and mean/p95 per-row source
  lengths **477.45/859**; all 7,936 held-out rows measured **194.93/192/227** tokens per chunk and
  **660.24/1,390** per-row source. The 16 opaque seal words consume most of a tiny encoder's
  context while contributing no task information. Pending M0/M1/evaluator/comparator
  `687134`-`687138` were canceled while pending, before GPU allocation or any output write. The
  new isolated `compact_v2` tag scheme keeps a record-unique 13-token contamination guard as
  `Reference` plus 12 tokenizer-single-character words (14 tokens including punctuation, verified
  against `shohin-tok-32k.json`) and changes no v1 artifact. It must receive a fresh CPU build,
  independent audit, and token-cost report before matched H100 M0/M1 jobs are recreated.

- **2026-07-13 current custody check** — **Compact CLL v2 passes the combined correctness and
  efficiency admission.** CPU `687141` completed in **85s** with **223,996** train and **7,936**
  held-out rows, **16,000/384** counterfactual pairs, protocol
  `source_removed_readback_v2_compact_tags`, and zero audit failures. Train/eval SHA-256 are
  `8760df867b4da98dcc84b356eea8e0d70922e3280e868193216173603814c08c` /
  `dfcf852c0ca57b6bb58f4f7c1a775221e33e97aa261d79478cc3bf36e82e5fc7`. Hash-bound local/Newton
  token report `certified_latent_ledger_v1_v2_token_audit.json` is md5
  `89ac960e6eb12b0f2dbe25f42a9ee3d1`: train chunk/source means are
  **228.60/511.63 -> 41.44/92.74** tokens and held-out means are
  **194.93/660.24 -> 37.43/126.79**. Matched raw-190k M0 `687144` (slots=0) began isolated on
  evc38; M1 `687145` (slots=8) is pending resources. Both use 24,000 selected examples, 6,000
  updates, seed `20260715`, and fresh output paths. Pair-safe evaluations `687146/687147` and
  locked comparator `687148` remain dependency-held. No result is a reasoning claim unless the
  comparator's M0/zero/shuffled/counterfactual gates all pass.

- **2026-07-13 ~03:10** — **Compact CLL M0 is a valid no-memory floor.** Matched M0 `687144`
  completed all 6,000 updates in 1,181s. Held-out evaluator `687146` returned normal/zero/shuffled
  **11/631 = 1.743%** in every condition, with **0/128** correct-and-different counterfactual pairs.
  This is deliberately null evidence, not a CLL result. Matched eight-slot M1 `687145` remains
  isolated on evc35 with the same raw-190k base/data/seed/schedule; `687147` and comparator `687148`
  must finish before the route can advance or be rejected. Flagship `685084` remained healthy through
  observed step 191,530 at 154.30k tok/s; `ckpt_0191500.pt` exists on Newton and the next DR target is 200k.
- **2026-07-13 ~03:10** — **`evc36` is scheduler-idle but CUDA-unhealthy.** It advertised two
  unallocated H100 GPUs, so isolated `687150` requested one GPU and tried an actual CUDA tensor allocation.
  The job failed after 2m15s with `CUDA-capable device(s) is/are busy or unavailable`. Keep evc36 in the
  explicit bad-node exclusion; this diagnosis did not alter or delay flagship `685084` or M1 `687145`.
- **2026-07-13 ~03:15** — **Fresh raw-190k direct interaction separates a narrow stop defect from
  reasoning.** At the standard 128-token decode budget, the seven-case/five-turn MPS interview is
  **1/7 initial, 0/7 review, 1/7 verified fact, 0/7 compact-state reuse** (md5
  `86214f2d4b096a67950cb1885c4109fd`). A 32-token replay is **2/7 initial, 1/7 review, 1/7 fact,
  0/7 reuse** (md5 `6f37c4fcf44351773981c83c12c68811`) because one state-update trace correctly reaches
  49 before the longer decode loops. It still computes `29 x 16 = 496`, treats base-6 425 as 0.425,
  ignores verified facts, and cannot reuse a state. This is explicitly not a thinking claim or a decoder
  optimization to promote; it identifies answer commitment as one interface issue after a model has learned
  substantially broader verified operations.
- **2026-07-13 ~03:22** — **The raw-190k decoder-depth effect fails to generalize.** The exact same
  fresh 48-case QA matrix at max-new 32 vs 128 is **8/48 vs 7/48**; only one state-update case changes.
  Both budgets score 7/8 syllogisms and zero across 8 arithmetic, 8 base-conversion, 8 sorting, and 8
  string-insertion cases. The hash-bound MPS artifacts are `89889f3616cae656c415bf277244c67f` and
  `83ea629a248655bc4b7ceec3ecb8ec66`. Reject decoder-budget/answer-commitment tuning as a broad route;
  keep the effect only as a future interface diagnostic.
- **2026-07-13 ~03:25** — **Stokes is ready for CPU-only work.** Read-only SSH validation reached
  `euser1`, confirmed 64 CPUs, and verified the shared Lustre root `/lustre/fs1/home/sa305415` with ample
  space. Future generation, audit, packing, and report jobs should use Stokes after a single-writer/output
  check, leaving Newton H100 capacity for the flagship and GPU experiments.
- **2026-07-13 ~03:37** — **Compact CLL v2 is rejected by its locked causal gate.** M1 `687145` completed
  cleanly. Held-out normal/zero/shuffled is **16/631 / 4/631 / 12/631**; M0 remains **11/631** in every
  mode. Comparator `687148` is `advance=false`: fit only gains **0.79pp** over the strongest control,
  length+language only **0.63pp**, there are two rather than three positive chunk margins, and no complete
  intervention pair is correct-and-different (**0/128**). The answer-only packet can affect a few fit
  answers but cannot retain a compositional source state. Reports are mirrored locally with md5
  `526e9a2c365ff195bb369fd5c49ae60a` / `bf831f2e8ea4d8528dbe44da6343aac9`; never promote this route.
- **2026-07-13 ~03:50** — **Continuous latent rollout is also rejected against its actual matched control.**
  The shared 896-case depth/language screen shows no-latent `687048` at **190/896 = 21.21%** and the
  progressive-L4 model `687049` at **173/896 = 19.31%** even with L=4 inference. The candidate loses
  every nonzero regime and only ties full OOD at zero; its within-model L=0→L=4 increase is a misleading
  comparison because the separately trained no-latent model is stronger. This rules out more answer-only
  soft-token rollout. In response, the next bounded source-free mechanism is **latent state algebra**:
  training-only state/delta/equivalence/separation geometry with verified commutation and intervention
  pairs, a matched answer-only control, shuffled pair and permuted code controls, and locked held-out
  equivalence/intervention gates. Generator, audit, trainer, evaluator metadata, comparator, and CPU smoke
  tests are complete locally; route only its unique CPU data build through Stokes next, then require a fresh
  audit before any H100 mechanics canary.
- **2026-07-13 ~04:00** — **Latent-state-algebra v1 is CPU-admitted; only a bounded mechanics canary is
  queued.** The first 32k-pair Stokes build exposed and stopped on an over-strict *intra-train* 13-gram
  uniqueness condition at pair 19,772 before writing artifacts. The condition was corrected to the
  intended train/eval decontamination boundary, regression-smoked locally at 2,048 pairs, then rebuilt
  from scratch on Stokes. The new independent audit passes **64,000** train rows and **2,304** held-out
  rows: zero malformed rows, duplicate prompts, exact/13-gram train-eval hits, or invalid pairs; train
  SHA-256 **`7bdf783797981863caca8fc82d6c0c857b948e678c00c5ac5794220eabc4cd53`**, held-out
  **`83d14d65f319decebe3195ffc7b20269161a299212142f3bd555875b8dcd7f3a`**, audit md5
  **`6d3c0b7c18619017bcf6732e3a45867a`**. Isolated `687158` is a 256-pair, one-H100 mechanics-only
  canary from immutable `best_step190000.pt`, excluding the active/bad nodes and writing solely to
  `train/lsa_canary_190k`. It must prove CUDA, finite pair losses, data binding, and source removal
  before any matched answer-only/control/candidate experiment is submitted. It cannot access or alter
  flagship `685084`.
- **2026-07-13 ~04:13** — **LSA mechanics passed; r1 data was then correctly rejected at the evaluator
  boundary, and r2 is now the only admissible experiment chain.** `687158` finished its 256-pair H100
  mechanics run in 69s: 64 finite updates, source-removed checkpoint metadata, and hash-bound r1 data;
  it is a transport check only. A read-through of the generic held-out evaluator caught that r1 rows lacked
  its deterministic `reference` key, which is necessary to prove case matching and temporal shuffle
  controls. Full r1 jobs `687164/687165` were canceled after 27/26s before any model artifact, rather than
  producing unevaluable results. The generator now emits row-level `reference=pair_id-pair_member`; the
  audit rejects missing/noncanonical/duplicate references and the trainer requires those zero-count fields.
  Fresh Stokes r2 output is **64,000/2,304** rows with every prior audit gate plus zero duplicate
  references: train/eval SHA-256 **`a73c5068f9c775ea6b40b42335e01ad4f792657aeba4688d3aca42d853becb58`** /
  **`6a9619ebc73f1778dbb13d69d903de1790ce0292f231c437f35e282a934581da`**, audit md5
  **`19ac94a6f42546c55596ece6a76ffc8f`**. Matched control `687168` (`ZERO_AUXILIARY=1`) and verified
  state-algebra candidate `687169` both start from immutable `best_step190000.pt`, same r2 data/seed/BS=4,
  and separate output directories. Complete held-out source-removed normal/zero/shuffled evaluations
  `687170/687171` and locked comparator `687172` are dependency-held. No job references flagship paths.
- **2026-07-13 ~04:29** — **Corrected data admission now blocks an undersized FineWeb replacement.**
  FineWeb job `686530` finished but its manifest contains only **4,599,748,648** tokens because the
  scale script was pinned to `sample-10BT`; it is preserved and explicitly rejected as a 25B corpus,
  not "approved by scan" or eligible for a future `SHARDS` relaunch. The scale script now defaults to
  `sample-100BT`, takes an explicit `DATASET_CONFIG`, and refuses publication unless the manifest has
  at least **24.5B** tokens. The admission tool now recognizes the tokenizer's historical `tokens`
  manifest key as well as `total_tokens`, with a regression test. Stokes CPU job **`738030`** is running
  on `ec52`, writes only `fineweb_edu_25b_r2.partial`, and cannot atomically publish without the new
  token-floor check; it remains future-only and still needs a full scan plus hash-bound approval. This
  work is isolated from active flagship `685084`, which remained healthy through observed step
  **192,950** at **154.29k tok/s**. Matched LSA r2 control `687168` and candidate `687169` were both
  finite through step 900/7,163 and remain under their preregistered evaluator/comparator gate.
- **2026-07-13 ~04:35** — **LSA now has an explicit second causal stage rather than an overclaimed
  primary result.** The running r2 jobs are unchanged: `687168` and `687169` remain the matched
  answer-only/verified-geometry primary screen, with their already-submitted evaluators and comparator
  frozen. A code audit caught that this primary comparator cannot itself test the two promised *training*
  controls: shuffled pair relations and permuted state codes. New local-only
  `compare_latent_state_algebra_stage2.py` is deliberately separate from the active path. If and only if
  stage one advances, it will bind four all-held-out reports and their checkpoint metadata: answer-only,
  verified candidate, shuffled-pair, and permuted-state. It requires matching init/data/seed/update
  metadata, source-removed decoding, and a **>=5pp** candidate advantage over every decoder and training
  control on fit, length/language, equivalent pairs, and intervention pairs. Synthetic contracts passed;
  no stage-two GPU job is queued yet, so a failed primary gate spends no further H100 time.
- **2026-07-13 ~04:42** — **The next flagship handoff is data-gated, not just throughput-gated.**
  Held fallback `686732` correctly preserves a two-H100 continuation but its submitted snapshot uses the
  old math/code-only stream. It remains the continuity fallback, not an automatic quality promotion. Future
  language/reasoning relaunch scripts now default only to `fineweb_edu_25b_r2` and its r2 approval record,
  never the rejected 4.6B `sample-10BT` output. They reject any non-524,288-token update and verify the
  allocated CUDA device count before allowing `NG>1` DDP. Before `685084` ends, replace `686732` only if
  both r2 FineWeb and DCLM prove their 25B manifests plus hash-bound full scans/approvals; otherwise retain
  `686732` so data construction cannot create an idle-training gap.
- **2026-07-13 ~04:46** — **Pre-sleep baseline recorded from live systems.** Flagship `685084` is
  RUNNING on evc22 through **193,290** at **154,295 tok/s**. Recent loss is **1.4727** with gnorm
  **0.10**; the sole new guard skip at step 193,173 recovered on the next logged step, so no intervention
  is warranted. Remote numbered checkpoints extend through `ckpt_0193250.pt`; full 190k DR remains
  hash-matched locally/Newton at `3e195aaf44a14259797c49d7f80d9c7f`, and 200k is the next transfer
  target. Matched LSA answer-only control `687168` and verified-geometry candidate `687169` are both
  finite and matched at roughly 2.3k/7,163 updates; their evaluator/comparator chain is still held, so
  there is no causal result yet. DCLM `686529` has written 183 partial 100M-token shards (about 18.3B
  tokens) but is retrying transient HF 503s; it remains live and unadmitted. Stokes FineWeb r2 `738030`
  is RUNNING on ec52 and has emitted its first 100,001,543-token partial shard; it remains unadmitted
  until the >=24.5B manifest floor and full scan/approval are present. No live writer was modified.
- **2026-07-13 ~04:52** — **Prefix-supervised packet-memory mechanics are ready locally, but no GPU
  trial is admitted.** `SourceDroppingMemory.encode(..., return_trace=True)` now exposes only the
  continuous packet after each source write; the answer boundary remains final packet plus fresh query
  with all source text absent. New `prefix_state_supervision.py` solver-recomputes each operation-prefix
  state and trains state/delta probes at every write, addressing the final-state-only credit-assignment
  weakness of LSA. CPU tests prove final-trace identity, writer/model gradients, exact prefix targets,
  delta targets, and all existing LSA contracts. This is a forward-only fallback: submit it only if
  the current LSA causal gate rejects or demonstrates that the added prefix signal is the next justified
  ablation. Any future trial must retain matched final-only, shuffled-prefix-label, and no-memory controls;
  it cannot alter `685084` or reuse an active experiment output.
- **2026-07-13 ~05:02** — **The prefix-state fallback is now a complete locked experiment, still
  unsubmitted.** New `prefix_state_memory_train.py` writes one source-free packet trace per input chunk,
  applies solver-recomputed normalized state and delta losses at every trace position, and scores the
  answer from that same final packet without recomputing/reintroducing source text. Its `ZERO_AUXILIARY=1`
  answer-only control and `PREFIX_MODE=shuffled` label control preserve init/data/seed/batch/update count.
  `compare_prefix_state_memory.py` rejects unless the verified-prefix candidate clears answer-only,
  zero-packet, shuffled-source, and shuffled-prefix controls by 10pp IID / 5pp OOD / 10pp on both
  equivalence and intervention pairs. CPU tests cover source removal, one-pass packet loss equivalence,
  solver targets, gradient flow, trainer labels, comparator success, and comparator rejection. It is
  explicitly conditioned on the in-flight LSA result; no Slurm job has been submitted and no live process
  reads these files.
- **2026-07-13 ~05:07** — **Pre-sleep live baseline and prefix-target audit recorded.** Flagship
  `685084` is RUNNING on evc22 through **193,680** at **154,295 tok/s**: loss **1.5811**, gnorm
  **0.09**, LR 0.0050, and direct H100 telemetry at 100% compute utilization, 63,767 / 81,559 MiB
  VRAM, and 280 / 310 W. The sole new guard skip at 193,437 recovered on the next logged step; latest
  numbered checkpoint is `ckpt_0193500.pt`, while verified full local/Newton DR remains 190k at md5
  `3e195aaf44a14259797c49d7f80d9c7f`; 200k is the next transfer milestone. Matched LSA r2 control
  `687168` and verified-geometry candidate `687169` are both finite and matched through roughly
  **3,940 / 7,163** updates, so their held-out evaluator/comparator chain remains the only valid
  primary decision path. CPU-only prefix-state audit `738032` passed against the exact r2 train SHA
  `a73c5068f9c775ea6b40b42335e01ad4f792657aeba4688d3aca42d853becb58`: **64,000** rows,
  **191,998** recomputed prefix positions, zero invalid rows, and report md5
  `b83805b22343c93f962db8db57114b9a`. This admits the prefix labels as mechanically correct, not the
  new training recipe; no prefix GPU job is submitted. DCLM `686529` remains live at **188** partial
  100M-token shards (about 18.8B), still unadmitted; no live writer or `SHARDS` input was changed.
- **2026-07-13 ~05:34** — **Causal Prefix Readback (CPR) is ready as the next, still-unsubmitted
  source-free context-scaling ablation.** The target failure mode is specific: an auxiliary probe can
  fit continuous packets while the model's own language decoder remains unable to read an intermediate
  packet. CPR therefore asks the decoder, after *every* source write, a fresh question about one
  solver-recomputed register; the decoder receives only that prefix packet and the question, never source
  text. The equal-decoder-work controls are explicit: `replicated-final` repeats the ordinary final query
  from the final packet at every prefix, and `shuffled` assigns another example's complete prefix
  readback labels to each packet. Both final answer and held-out prefix readback remain source-free.
  Independent Stokes audit `738034` passed against r2 train SHA
  `a73c5068f9c775ea6b40b42335e01ad4f792657aeba4688d3aca42d853becb58`: **64,000** rows,
  **191,998** readback targets, zero invalid rows or answer leakage, report md5
  `12c8191bb159d716556ecfad6096e098`. CPU preflight `738036` caught an unacceptable extra 1,471
  shape buckets from variable-length numeric answers before any GPU allocation; CPR was corrected to
  group only the source-free decoder readbacks inside the established source-write batches. Replacement
  Stokes preflight `738038` passes with **32,000** complete pairs, **2,242** source/final buckets,
  **7,163** full batches, and **3,348** dropped pairs — exactly the current LSA batch surface, with no
  additional CPR-induced loss. Trainer/evaluator/comparator and tests are complete locally and synced to
  Newton. **No CPR H100 job is submitted:** it is conditioned on the in-flight LSA primary result and
  cannot modify `685084`, its corpus, or any live experiment output.
- **2026-07-13 05:39** — **Overnight comparison baseline captured from live systems.** Flagship `685084`
  is RUNNING on evc22 through **194,220** at **154,298 tok/s**: loss **1.4431**, gnorm **0.11**, LR
  0.0050, and **101,827,215,360 nominal update tokens**. It has no new guard skips after the recovered
  193,437 outlier. Durable recovery remains the hash-matched 190k pair
  `best_step190000.pt` / `train/flagship_out/ckpt_0190000.pt` at md5
  `3e195aaf44a14259797c49d7f80d9c7f`; 200k is about 5.5 hours away at the measured rate and is the next
  mandatory remote+local promotion. Matched LSA r2 answer-only control `687168` and verified geometry
  candidate `687169` are both RUNNING and finite through **6,220 / 7,163** and **6,260 / 7,163** updates,
  respectively, at 4.9 pairs/s. Their held-out source-free evaluators `687170/687171` and locked
  comparator `687172` remain dependency-held; no causal claim is permitted before that chain completes.
  DCLM `686529` has **195** partial 100M-token shards (about 19.5B tokens) and FineWeb r2 has **6**
  partial 100M-token shards. Both remain unadmitted, excluded from the live writer, and require their
  full manifest/scan/approval gates. The only pending flagship successor is `686732`, two H100s after
  `685084`; it cannot share or modify the active writer.
- **2026-07-13 05:52** — **LSA primary training completed cleanly and a direct 190k behavior diagnosis
  narrowed the failure mode.** Matched answer-only control `687168` and verified-geometry candidate
  `687169` each completed all **7,163** updates in 5,814s / 5,800s, respectively, with finite losses and
  independently written checkpoints. Full held-out source-free normal/zero/shuffled evaluators
  `687170/687171` are now running on their released H100s; locked comparator `687172` remains held after
  both. No result is inferred from their close in-training answer losses. Separately, local MPS capability
  matrix `capability_matrix_raw190k_seed20260713_all_contracts_mps.json` (mirrored to Newton; md5
  `abd71f2a9c9b504e1f36a2735d0ead17`) scores normal Q/A **5/24**, direct **2/24**, CoT **1/24**, and
  one-shot **3/24**. The normal Q/A score is four syllogisms plus one state-update; all arithmetic,
  base-conversion, sort, and string families are zero in every prompt contract. One separate manual
  state-update response emitted the correct intermediate sequence and `49` before looping, but the matrix
  confirms that this is rare and prompt changes do not unlock general computation. Treat this as evidence
  for stronger state/decoder supervision, not an output-format-only explanation or a thinking claim.
- **2026-07-13 06:22** — **Explicit overnight comparison snapshot.** Flagship `685084` is RUNNING on
  evc22 through **194,990** at **154,297 tok/s**, with recent step loss **1.4823**, gnorm **0.10**, and
  **102,230,917,120 nominal update tokens**. No new guard skip followed the isolated recovered 193,437
  event. The 190k local/Newton DR pair remains md5 `3e195aaf44a14259797c49d7f80d9c7f`; 200k is the next
  mandatory preservation. LSA evaluators `687170/687171` are still running their locked held-out
  normal/zero/shuffled source-free protocol; `687172` remains dependency-held, so no causal result or
  next-stage launch is yet warranted. DCLM `686529` reached 204 partial ~100M-token shards (about 20.4B)
  and remains unadmitted. Stokes FineWeb replacement `738030` is RUNNING on ec52 with **11** partial
  ~100M-token shards (about 1.1B), also unadmitted. This snapshot is the user-facing comparison
  baseline for the next morning.
- **2026-07-13 06:32** — **LSA r2 rejected; causal prefix-readback launched as the next causal test.**
  Locked comparator `687172` reports `advance=false`: fit-IID normal margin **+1.04pp** versus the
  preregistered +10pp requirement; combined length/language OOD **+0.09pp** versus +5pp; equivalent
  pairs **+0.52pp** versus +10pp; intervention pairs **0/576** for every arm; only two (not three)
  chunk-count wins. Thus the auxiliary latent geometry did not create a robust causal retained state;
  no LSA stage 2 is warranted. The final control/candidate/comparison reports are mirrored locally at
  md5 `af9c6f40d066040a52505fa49cfd9c37`, `2d465a4d38a1aa09cf090f7fab07b90f`, and
  `6810722f720c1ad8d2874de4e4ff5329`. The next experiment is causal prefix readback, a source-free
  decoder-readback control designed to distinguish language-decoder use of an intermediate packet from
  an auxiliary-probe fit; its corrected submission is recorded in the next entry.
- **2026-07-13 06:43** — **CPR launch corrected and reaches healthy finite updates.** The first
  `687216/687217/687218` CPR submission correctly refused the CPR-specific audit before model loading:
  the trainer requires the generic hash-bound LSA admission audit, while the CPR audit remains a
  separately preserved protocol validation. Canceled their never-satisfiable `687219/687220/687221`
  dependencies; no checkpoint or model result exists from that first attempt. Corrected three-arm jobs
  `687223` verified, `687224` shuffled complete-label, and `687225` replicated-final replay use generic
  audit SHA `8c6138c5ff968923a5df58f9547277532b09c9fb193ab1999291e4c4e56ce26f` and the CPR audit bound to
  data SHA `a73c5068f9c775ea6b40b42335e01ad4f792657aeba4688d3aca42d853becb58`. All three passed startup
  and have finite, descending step-80 losses on the exact matched 32,000-pair / 7,163-update surface.
  Clean separate evaluators `687226/687227/687228` are `afterok`-held. This tests whether the language
  decoder, rather than an auxiliary probe, can read intermediate source-free packets; none can write to
  or otherwise affect `685084`. The job wrapper now also rejects a CPR protocol audit in the `AUDIT`
  slot before CUDA initialization, so this input-class mistake cannot consume another H100 allocation.
- **2026-07-13 09:34** — **All CPR matched training arms complete; held-out decoder-readback gate runs.**
  Verified `687223`, shuffled-label `687224`, and equal-work replicated-final `687225` each completed
  the exact 32,000-pair / 7,163-update surface from immutable `best_step190000.pt` with exit 0 in
  2h50m / 2h52m / 2h38m. Their separate checkpoint md5s are
  `7d84282c3daaa4a238db821ff8c69ed3`, `162282f3db4d7f6ce064b252be5bc35d`, and
  `6c4f11caeae9701d7fd09fef957833a3`. Full all-held-out source-free decoder-readback evaluators
  `687226/687227/687228` are RUNNING; they test normal, zero-packet, and shuffled-source modes on
  every prefix and report to isolated JSONs. No early normal-mode count is a result; wait for all three
  modes and the locked four-control comparator before either claiming or rejecting decoder-accessible
  intermediate state.
- **2026-07-13 11:12** — **200k flagship recovery checkpoint preserved.** `685084` reached step
  **200,000** cleanly at loss **1.6200**, gnorm **0.11**, and **154,296 tok/s**. Promoted Newton
  `best_step200000.pt` and resumed the local SFTP `.part` transfer until local
  `train/flagship_out/ckpt_0200000.pt` matched at md5 `510d57df578447986b40e20029511b9d`. This is a
  full optimizer checkpoint and the current local/Newton DR target is complete.
- **2026-07-13 11:27** — **Explicit overnight comparison snapshot refreshed.** Flagship `685084` is
  RUNNING on evc22 through **200,360** at **154,294 tok/s**: loss **1.6012**, gnorm **0.09**, LR
  0.0050, and **105,046,343,680 nominal update tokens**. The full 200k optimizer checkpoint remains
  durable on both Newton and the Mac at md5 `510d57df578447986b40e20029511b9d`; next DR target is
  210k. CPR verified and shuffled-label evaluators have completed, while equal-work replay evaluator
  `687228` is still running its held-out shuffled-source mode; do not make a CPR causal claim until
  its report and the locked comparator exist. CPU corpus progress is deliberately quarantined: DCLM
  `686529` completed **25,000,001,792** decontaminated tokens in 250 shards (17,370,366 kept docs)
  but requires a fresh full admission scan; OpenMath PT `685700` completed **5,000,000,144** tokens
  in 50 shards and is also future-handoff-only; Stokes FineWeb r2 `738030` is running at 52 complete
  100M-token shards (about 5.2B) toward its 25B floor. None changes the active writer or its SHARDS.
- **2026-07-13 11:36** — **CPR decisively rejected; live pretrain remains healthy.** Flagship `685084`
  is RUNNING on evc22 through **200,560** at **154,293 tok/s**, loss **1.4530**, gnorm **0.08**, with
  numbered `ckpt_0200500.pt`. Direct GPU telemetry is 100% utilization, 63,767 / 81,559 MiB, and
  301 / 310 W. The isolated step-200,387 gnorm skip recovered at the next logged step; no persistent
  instability exists. All CPR evaluators and the locked four-control comparator are complete: verified
  normal source-free readback is **161/10,752 = 1.497%**, exactly equal to shuffled source, while
  equal-work replay is **193/10,752 = 1.795%**. Fit IID / length OOD / language OOD / full OOD margins
  are **-1.273 / -0.493 / -0.347 / -0.439pp** and every preregistered gate is false. This rejects
  decoder-readable continuous packets; no stage 2 or flagship integration is authorized. The next
  isolated design hypothesis is a discrete Digitwise Recurrent Scratchpad with local carry/PC/tape
  transitions, not another continuous-memory variant. DCLM remains quarantined pending a fresh scan;
  Stokes FineWeb `738030` is healthy through shard 53 (about 5.4B tokens). No live `SHARDS` changed.

- **2026-07-13 12:04** — **Live 200k interaction and first DRS data gate recorded.** Flagship `685084`
  remains RUNNING on evc22 through **200,920** at **154,291 tok/s**; direct `nvidia-smi` reported
  94% compute utilization, 63,767 / 81,559 MiB VRAM, and 297 / 310 W. The latest 200k local
  transcript-first probe is deliberately not a benchmark: `ckpt_0200000.pt` scores **1/7** initial,
  **0/7** after self-review, **1/7** with a verified intermediate fact, and **0/7** after compact-state
  reuse, exactly matching the prior 190k directional result. The only pass is the syllogism; this is
  no evidence of a qualitative capability jump. Artifact
  `artifacts/eval_history/manual_capability_raw200k_20260713_mps32.json` has md5
  `eb3e06aa2039ceb77adf17dbc3301fd3`. In parallel, Stokes DRS build `738117` completed 439,865
  immutable train rows and 1,500 paired held-out episodes, but independent audit `738120` rejected
  it with 27 13-gram train/held-out overlaps. Inspection proved the leak was shared operand tapes
  across opposite operations, which the initial exact-state signature missed. The immutable v1 data
  and failed audit remain preserved and are not admissible. A corrected generator reserves operand
  tapes across operation/counterfactual branches; local 1,000-episode smoke and audit show zero
  exact/13-gram overlap. Stokes `738122 -> 738123` now builds and audits separately named v2 artifacts.
  The v2 Stokes audit passed after this entry: see the subsequent v2 journal entry and the DRS live-state row.

- **2026-07-13 12:16** — **DRS v2 admission passed; isolated causal GPU chain launched.** Stokes
  `738122 -> 738123` rebuilt the candidate without modifying immutable rejected v1. The read-only v2
  audit passed **439,865** train rows and **1,500** held-out counterfactual episodes across all five
  regimes (19,800 held-out controller prompts), with **0** invalid rows, duplicate normalized prompts,
  exact held-out hits, or 13-gram held-out overlaps. Train/eval SHA-256 are
  `381b8bbf3a4eddb7b08b0f9d4b08ea3ce65e1f0ec48de930632d54417c2f7f35` and
  `89ce11b36ff2f56e83cda72a1f07b1a90f4a3dc3803c69db2779a27219712646`; they were verified after a
  direct Stokes-to-Newton transfer. GPU `687348` is now running on non-flagship H100 node evc38 to
  measure the raw 200k self-authored closed-loop baseline. None of these jobs reads/writes the flagship output, touches live
  `SHARDS`, or constitutes a reasoning claim before matched regime-level results are inspected.

- **2026-07-13 12:24** — **DRS measurement control tightened before SFT.** The running raw held-out
  evaluation `687348` was left unchanged. Its dependency-held children `687350`/`687351` were canceled
  before allocation or output, because v2's held-out lexical wrapper would otherwise confound local
  algorithmic execution with ordinary wording transfer. New `eval_digitwise_recurrent.py` accepts an
  explicit `core`/`heldout`/`auto` style and has a unit-tested core override. The replacement, verified
  Slurm chain is `687348` raw held-out -> `687362` raw core on the same episodes -> `687363` one-epoch
  SFT -> `{687364 core, 687365 held-out}` matched post-SFT evaluations. This adds no training data and
  cannot alter the flagship; it makes a positive or negative DRS result diagnostically usable.

- **2026-07-13 12:49** — **Direct interaction remains weak; ADL entered CPU-only admission.** The
  200k local probe is the human-readable diagnosis, not a benchmark: 1/7 initial, 0/7 self-review,
  1/7 supplied-fact, and 0/7 compact-state reuse. Its arithmetic response asserts `29 * 16 = 496`,
  base conversion emits ratios, list/string prompts fall into memorized code scaffolds, and the
  Python predicate reverses the required condition. This is evidence of a procedural/decoder failure,
  not a hidden benchmark-only capability. At the concurrent live check `685084` was healthy through
  201,620 at 154,287 tok/s (latest loss 1.8294, gnorm 0.10), with `ckpt_0201500.pt` present and no
  new persistent instability. Raw DRS `687348` remains isolated and running at 0 finals through
  240/500. In parallel, after local and Stokes import/test smoke passed, Stokes CPU job `738186` was
  submitted to build the separate Append-only Delta Ledger corpus; dependent audit `738187` will
  independently recompute rows and overlap checks. ADL has no GPU job and cannot affect the flagship
  or DRS chain.

- **2026-07-13 13:03** — **Answer likelihood rules out a hidden emission-only capability.** A new,
  transcript-adjacent forced-choice probe scored the correct completion against matched wrong completions
  under the same plain `Question/Answer` prompt. Raw 200k ranks the correct candidate first on only
  **1/7** fresh cases (mean correct rank **2.571**): arithmetic 3/4, base conversion 4/4, state update
  3/4, linear equation 2/4, sort/dedup 1/4, string insertion 3/4, and logic 2/2. In particular it ranks
  `yes` above the correct `no` for the fresh syllogism. Artifact
  `artifacts/eval_history/forced_choice_raw200k_20260713_mps.json` md5
  `7b6bcdd58f6420703fcb0b6bbbfa3afd`. This does not prove general ability absent under every prompt
  contract, but it does reject the narrower explanation that the model already has reliable answers and
  only fails free emission. The next mechanism must teach validated local computation/state rather than
  a cosmetic chain-of-thought surface.

- **2026-07-13 13:04** — **ADL full admission passed; DRS SFT boundary was repaired before allocation.**
  Stokes build `738186` committed 384,000 ADL train rows and 1,000 paired held-out episodes; its
  independent audit `738187` recomputed every transition and passed with 0 invalid rows/episodes,
  duplicate prompts, exact overlap, or 13-gram overlap over 42,000 held-out controller prompts. The
  hash-matched train/held-out artifacts and audit report are present on Newton. Separately, inspecting
  the pending DRS SFT script exposed an inference-boundary bug: DRS rows include a full
  `completion_prompt` ending in `Answer:`, but the held script would have wrapped it in an additional
  `Question: ... Answer:` surface. Because Slurm snapshots scripts at submission, merely syncing the
  source would not fix it. Canceled unstarted `687363/687364/687365` before outputs, synchronized the
  corrected wrapper, and submitted `687375 -> {687376,687377}` with the same data/checkpoint/dependencies.
  `scontrol write batch_script 687375` verifies the stored `--prompt-override-field completion_prompt`
  and exact-boundary preflight. This is a valid experimental repair, not a model result.

- **2026-07-13 13:05** — **Raw DRS executor is absent; raw ADL microstep likelihood is at chance.**
  Raw held-out DRS `687348` completed all 500 episodes: every regime has 0 first transitions, state
  loops, finals, counterfactual finals, and paired interventions. It produced 434 unique first responses
  (mode count 67), mostly malformed markdown/repetition rather than one fixed answer; this is a valid
  raw baseline, not a rejection of SFT learnability. Core-wrapped raw control `687362` began on evc38
  and is the lexical-interface discriminator. Separately, `probe_append_ledger_microsteps.py` asked the
  raw 200k model to rank the 20 grammar-valid first `adl:step=0;d=<digit>;c=<carry>` choices for eight
  fixed arithmetic tapes under both core and held-out wording. Correct local transition is never top-1
  (**0/16**, mean rank **10.688/20**); `d=0;c=0` wins all 16 prompts. Artifact
  `artifacts/eval_history/append_ledger_microstep_raw200k_20260713_mps.json` md5
  `9ae4c88aca13079fe69036a47b88e597`. This rejects the claim that raw pretraining already contains a
  reliably readable local arithmetic primitive, but supports a supervised learnability comparison.

- **2026-07-13 13:30** — **Direct counterfactual-verifier probe rejects a hidden self-checker.** The
  raw 200k model was shown 48 balanced DRS local transitions: half exact successors and half
  grammar-valid near misses that changed only a digit, carry/borrow, or immutable operand tape. Free
  generation emitted no usable `verdict=valid|invalid` response (**0/48**), mostly bare digit lists and
  repeated document fragments. That could have been an answer-surface failure, so the exact two verdict
  completions were likelihood-ranked too: the model selected `valid` on **all 48**, yielding exactly
  **24/48 = 50%**. Artifact
  `artifacts/eval_history/transition_verifier_likelihood_raw200k_20260713_mps.json` md5
  `fb7bbdbb1fa16104117f09c6c3faa07c`. Therefore a proposed proof-carrying deliberation loop may not be
  treated as an emergent raw ability; it is conditional on DRS first proving supervised core local
  execution, then must beat a matched label-shuffled verifier control on the model's own sampled states.
  This adds no training job and cannot affect the flagship.

- **2026-07-13 13:42** — **Canonical wording does not uncover a hidden DRS executor.** Core-wrapped
  raw control `687362` completed cleanly on evc38 (42m12s, exit 0) against the identical 500 paired
  episodes used by held-out-wrapped `687348`. It is **0/500** first transitions, closed loops, final
  answers, counterfactual finals, and paired interventions in every 100-case `fit_w4`, `fit_w6`,
  `value_ood_w4`, `value_ood_w6`, and `width_ood_w8` regime. The result md5 is
  `20a5d4cc4a776ee3ffb9220f288f4f6a`; it emitted 34 unique first responses with a high mode count of
  265, so the zero is not a single constant-output artifact. This resolves the raw lexical-interface
  question negatively. Hash-bound, exact-boundary one-epoch SFT `687375` then began independently on
  evc32; its successor evaluations remain dependency-held. In parallel, `REASONING_FRONTIER.md` now
  records the Counterfactual Bisimulation Compiler hypothesis: language-to-state compilation, source-free
  state advancement, inverse delta explanation, multi-query readout, and causal paraphrase/counterfactual
  controls. It is not a capability claim and has no live-training path.

*Keep this file honest. When you hit a milestone, do the work, then come back and update §1 (LIVE
STATE) and any step that changed. A future agent — maybe you after a context reset — is relying on it.*

- **2026-07-13 ~13:55** — **Flagship custody is intentionally hands-off; capability research is
  concentrated on the isolated causal path.** Per project direction, do not perform routine live-flagship
  monitoring or alter the active writer. Uncompiled DRS v2 SFT `687459` has passed its hash-bound data
  and exact completion-boundary preflights and reached **200 / 1,561** updates with finite loss falling
  from `0.6846` to `0.0541`; GPU telemetry is 100% utilization at about 63.9GiB. This is only fit
  evidence, not an execution or reasoning result. Its source-free core, held-out, direct-interaction,
  and NLL jobs remain serialized after successful completion. In parallel, `REASONING_FRONTIER.md`
  records a **Dual-Code Reversible Deliberation** hypothesis: one model carries state through two
  per-episode randomized token codes, forward and inverse transitions must close across the codes, and
  the controller may only transport text and compare exact strings before accepting or abstaining. It is
  conditional on a positive DRS causal result, has no submitted job or flagship path, and must beat
  matched repeated-lane, shuffled-codebook, identity-format, corruption, coverage, and
  counterfactual-interchange controls before it is treated as useful.

- **2026-07-13 14:46** — **The DRS fit phase is complete; causal evaluation, not loss, now decides.**
  Isolated uncompiled `687459` completed one DRS v2 SFT epoch from `best_step200000.pt` on evc49:
  439,865 hash-bound rows, 51,131,402 packed tokens, 10,623,342 answer tokens, 24,966 packed
  sequences, and **1,561** updates in **1,115s**. It wrote only
  `train/sft_digitwise_recurrent_v2_200k_r3/sft_ep1.pt` (MD5
  `6f30db16208d274229950b17662dda01`). Source-free core evaluator `687460` is running; the held-out
  wording evaluator, direct raw-versus-SFT interaction, and raw NLL monitor remain serialized after it.
  The small completion loss does not establish execution, causal state transport, or reasoning. Do not
  submit DCRD, ADL, CBC, or any flagship modification until this chain provides the needed causal result.

- **2026-07-13 14:52** — **DCRD has a tested CPU-only protocol substrate, not a training result.**
  `train/dual_code_reversible_protocol.py` now implements deterministic per-episode A/B encodings,
  strict code-specific parsing, solver-only inverse construction, and source-free prompts. Its local
  contract test covers codebook separation, encode/decode, canonical-state leakage rejection, and 120
  randomized reversible transitions. No DCRD data, controller rollout, SFT, or GPU job exists; it remains
  conditional on the full DRS core/held-out/direct chain and cannot affect active pretraining.

- **2026-07-13 15:02** — **DCRD generator/auditor preflight passed without weakening the contamination gate.**
  `pipeline/generate_dual_code_reversible_v1.py` emits forward-A, A-to-B, reverse-B, B-to-A, and readout
  targets; `pipeline/audit_dual_code_reversible_v1.py` independently recomputes every target plus every
  held-out state trajectory and counterfactual. The first implementation exposed **768 literal 13-gram
  train/held-out template overlaps on the smoke test**. That data was rejected, not normalized away. The
  fixed generator/auditor bind a held-out-only alias vocabulary to a structurally different held-out prompt style;
  the protocol itself permits crossed combinations only for later attribution controls.
  The end-to-end smoke and a larger **1,000-episode / 21,000-row** preflight with **200** held-out paired
  counterfactual episodes now report 0 malformed rows/episodes, duplicate prompts, exact held-out hits, or
  literal 13-gram overlaps. This is only CPU infrastructure: no durable DCRD corpus, controller, SFT, or
  GPU job is authorized until `687460 -> 687461 -> 687462` provides a positive DRS causal result.

- **2026-07-13 15:24** — **CBC generator/auditor preflight passed with a causal counterfactual gate.**
  `train/bisimulation_compiler_protocol.py` defines a strict `cbc:` state and `cbc-delta:` grammar; its
  source-free update and readout prompts have no solver/controller fallback. The paired
  `pipeline/generate_counterfactual_bisimulation_v1.py` and
  `pipeline/audit_counterfactual_bisimulation_v1.py` independently reconstruct all compilation,
  transition, inverse-delta, and query targets, then require normal/counterfactual worlds to share every
  operation while differing in exactly one initial fact and final answer. A medium **1,000-episode /
  16,000-row** local preflight plus **120** held-out paired-counterfactual episodes reports 0 invalid rows,
  invalid episodes, normalized duplicate prompts, exact prompt hits, and literal 13-gram overlaps.
  Corruption tests reject altered targets and a semantically valid-looking mismatched counterfactual
  operation sequence. CBC has no
  durable corpus, controller, SFT, or GPU job; it remains gated on the serialized DRS causal chain.

- **2026-07-13 15:33** — **CBC's source-free transport controller is now independently tested.**
  `train/bisimulation_compiler_controller.py` may parse only model-emitted `cbc:` text, render the next
  source-free update/query prompt around it, and exact-compare outputs after the rollout. It does not call
  a semantic state transition or answer solver. Its deterministic test exercises primary rollout,
  inverse-delta checks, same-world compilation interchange, and normal-state versus counterfactual-world
  query mismatch; corrupting the first predicted state halts the rollout with no final-answer repair. This
  is evaluator infrastructure only. No CBC corpus, SFT checkpoint, or GPU job is authorized ahead of the
  DRS causal decision.

- **2026-07-13 15:38** — **DRS v2 coverage audit identified a precise OOD confound before interpreting its
  core curve.** `pipeline/audit_digitwise_position_coverage.py` is a read-only transition-context report.
  On immutable v2 it found no train transitions with operand digits 3–9 at width-4 position 3 or width-6
  position 5, for either tape. The fit regimes have 0 unseen digit-position/local contexts; each value-OOD
  regime has **1,200 / 600** and width-8 has **9,600 / 4,800**, respectively, across its complete paired
  held-out set. Any revised DRS data must stratify coverage by width, position, tape, operation, and
  carry/borrow before value-OOD performance can answer an algorithmic-generalization question. This
  diagnostic alters no existing data, checkpoint, or job and does not pre-judge the running causal chain.

- **2026-07-13 15:45 / 16:20** — **DRS v3 is a hash-admitted complete-transition-basis candidate, not a
  training result.** `train/digitwise_basis_protocol.py` enumerates 3,400 reachable local decimal contexts
  across width 4/6, operation, position, carry/borrow, and operand digits. The v3 generator constructs
  complete arithmetic episodes that hit each context while retaining real result-tape prefixes; its held-out
  evaluator worlds use unseen full tapes rather than an unseen numeric band. The independent admission
  audit recomputes all targets/counterfactuals, requires every one of the 3,400 contexts, and fails if any
  one context is removed. The medium 2-variant preflight contained 6,800 episodes / 77,946 rows with 0
  malformed rows/episodes, duplicates after deduplication, exact overlap, or literal 13-gram overlap. The
  durable eight-variant CPU artifact is now mirrored locally and on Newton: **27,200 episodes / 311,127
  rows**; train SHA-256 `b785866bf24813272d346e4a3bb717d4156b01a59a4dd8ccaf450733267368f6`, held-out
  900-episode SHA-256 `f2fcfcae41b55aa82dd360036bd8c9c00ed6e4ca442debec1c85ed282e50dfe1`, and the
  independent audit reports 0 invalid, duplicate, missing-context, exact, or 13-gram findings. It has no
  SFT checkpoint or submitted GPU job; wait for `687460 -> 687461 -> 687462` before execution.

- **2026-07-13 15:53** — **The DRS v3 launch contract is staged, not admitted for execution.**
  `train/jobs/sft_digitwise_basis_v3.sbatch` is isolated from the flagship and rejects an existing output,
  a non-v3 audit schema, any malformed/duplicate/overlap finding, a data or held-out SHA mismatch, any
  missing local context, or anything other than exactly 3,400 required and covered contexts across the
  three recombination/width-held-out regimes. It also proves that SFT uses the exact inference prompt
  boundary before taking CUDA. The static contract test passes. This creates no corpus and submits no job;
  it only makes a later positive-evidence test reproducible without weakening the admission gate.

- **2026-07-13 16:04** — **Static-Tape Recurrent Register (STRR) is a new CPU-preflighted causal
  representation candidate, not a training result.** The diagnosis is that original DRS makes every
  recurrent output regenerate immutable `a` and `b` operand tapes as well as the evolving `p/c/r/z`
  fields. STRR sends the immutable canonical `dwt:` tape again as fixed problem evidence each turn, but
  requires the model to emit only the `dwr:` register. Its transport-only controller never executes,
  repairs, or chooses a register; it merely reuses the original tape and forwards the exact model output.
  Generator/auditor preflight with two tape variants has 6,800 complete episodes / 77,946 rows, all 3,400
  reachable local contexts, 120 paired held-out counterfactual episodes, and 0 malformed, duplicate,
  counterfactual, exact-overlap, or literal 13-gram-overlap findings. Its matched closed-loop evaluator is
  static-tested. This factorization is a direct test of the repeated-immutable-copy burden, not external
  arithmetic assistance. It creates no durable corpus, SFT, or GPU allocation until the active DRS chain
  has yielded its core, held-out, and transcript evidence.

- **2026-07-13 16:14** — **The capability path now records regime-specific evidence before selecting
  another SFT.** Both digitwise evaluators accept `--examples-per-regime` and retain independently
  capped successful and failed paired closed-loop transcripts per regime. This is diagnostic only: it
  cannot influence a score, repair an output, or change a controller transition. The staged
  `sft_digitwise_factor_v1.sbatch` applies the same isolation, exact inference/SFT prompt-boundary,
  CUDA-allocation, overwrite-refusal, hash-binding, complete-3,400-context, counterfactual, and
  decontamination gates as the v3 basis job. It has not generated a durable factor corpus, reserved a
  GPU, or been submitted. The immediate purpose is to attribute current value/width failure to either
  incomplete local basis coverage or repeated immutable-tape copying before spending further training.

- **2026-07-13 16:25** — **DRS v2 core establishes local execution but rejects any broad-reasoning
  interpretation.** From the isolated `sft_ep1` checkpoint, `687460` gets **275/500** final answers under
  canonical core wording: 100/100 fit-w4, 98/100 fit-w6, 34/100 value-OOD-w4, 43/100 value-OOD-w6, and
  0/100 width-OOD-w8. Yet its very first model-authored microstate is correct on **497/500** episodes
  (100, 100, 100, 99, and 98 by the same regimes). The failure is therefore predominantly recurrent and
  path-dependent rather than a total inability to perform a local decimal transition. The complete v3
  basis remains a valid coverage control for unseen interior contexts, but **STRR becomes the first
  corrective representation experiment** once the pending held-out wording and direct transcript probes
  show whether removing immutable tape copying repairs multi-step transport. No broad, latent, or
  language-reasoning claim is permitted from this result.

- **2026-07-13 16:27** — **Repaired the pending DRS evidence chain before it consumed more resources.**
  The inherited core and pending descendants were manually submitted with two H100s even though every
  script has one process and chooses a single CUDA device. Core `687460` is already complete, so it was
  not touched. Unstarted `687461/687462/687463` were canceled with no output artifacts and replaced by
  one-H100 chain `687547` (held-out wording) -> `687548` (raw-versus-DRS direct interview) -> `687549`
  (raw NLL). `687549` now explicitly binds the frozen WikiText-103-test English and CodeContests-test
  Python monitor inputs that the old job omitted. The independent one-H100 `687542` core-transcript probe
  remains in parallel after `687460`. All replacements retain separate output paths, fixed raw/SFT
  checkpoints, and the same serial causal ordering; this correction cannot alter active pretraining.

- **2026-07-13 16:39** — **Bounded a second, clearly dead evaluator-startup failure.** `687542` and
  `687547` each stayed more than ten minutes in the initial `python -` CUDA smoke with no log output,
  0 MiB allocated VRAM, and negligible CPU; they produced no JSON artifact. Their two pending children
  were canceled with them. The evaluator wrappers now set the same `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1`,
  `MKL_NUM_THREADS=1`, `NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS=1`, and four-thread OpenMP limits used by successful SFT
  jobs. Fresh one-H100 replacements are `687554` (transcripts), `687555 -> 687556 -> 687557`
  (wording -> interview -> NLL). This is infrastructure hardening only; no data, checkpoint, score, or
  flagship state was changed.

- **2026-07-13 16:46** — **Verified the actual H100 runtime before a third evidence attempt.** The
  transient import stall cleared under a bounded `strace` control (`import torch` exited 0); no package or
  environment mutation was needed. Existing `cuda_h100_preflight.sbatch` job `687560` then passed on
  evc49 in four seconds, including a real bf16 CUDA matmul. The serial evidence chain is freshly rebuilt
  from that verified one-H100 allocation: `687562` transcript probe -> `687563` held-out wording ->
  `687564` manual raw-versus-DRS interaction -> `687565` raw NLL with explicit frozen monitor inputs.
  This avoids interpreting a scheduler/import transient as model behavior and avoids allocating more than
  one H100 at a time for diagnostics.

- **2026-07-13 17:15** — **Adopted a paper-derived workspace criterion without mistaking it for a
  capability result.** The external global-workspace study motivates a narrow testable claim: a useful
  compact state must be reportable, deliberately updateable, causally action-guiding, reusable by more
  than one downstream task, and robust to held-out recombinations. It does not license more visible
  chain-of-thought training. The expanded 80-direction raw residual-patching control is negative (carry
  deltas +0.001 to +0.028 with only 18–22/40 positive directions; digit deltas -0.042 to +0.0002 with
  only 14–20/40 positive), so there is no simple raw last-token broadcast register. The matching post-DRS
  diagnostic `687578` remains dependency-held after wording, direct-interaction, and NLL evidence. A
  conditional Counterfactual Workspace Induction design is documented in `REASONING_FRONTIER.md`: it
  trains only a later, training-time reflection that distinguishes a legal local register from a
  grammar-valid semantic foil, then tests the ordinary unreflected task with syntax-only,
  label-permutation, and equal-compute continuation controls. It cannot be trained unless STRR first
  establishes a generalizable primitive register.

- **2026-07-13 16:23** — **STRR now has a durable, independently admitted full corpus but no SFT.** The
  eight-variant artifact is mirrored locally/Newton with **27,200 episodes / 311,127 rows**, 3,400/3,400
  local contexts, and 900 paired held-out episodes. Train/held-out SHA-256 values are
  `82245615f0849c3270f99f2db85c604ff46cb2c3dfb14f0ab3660dff3eb0d3ec` /
  `a699ac58ad8184f4dc23dcfa317cd6e7b8f7d4ef453dcbf1ae21201901e0948a`; its independent audit reports
  zero invalid, duplicate, counterfactual, missing-context, exact-overlap, or 13-gram findings. This is
  materialized solely to make the transport-representation ablation reproducible after the transcript
  gate; it has no SFT checkpoint, GPU allocation, or capability score.

- **2026-07-13 18:05** — **TNDL passed full local admission rehearsal; it remains a CPU-only candidate.**
  The token-native delta-ledger control produces 27,200 train episodes / **169,115** deduplicated rows,
  covers all **3,400/3,400** local contexts, and has 900 held-out episodes (300 each recombine-w4,
  recombine-w6, and width-8). The independent full audit found zero invalid rows/episodes, duplicate
  normalized train prompts, counterfactual mismatches, missing contexts, exact prompt hits, or 13-gram
  train/held-out hits. Repeating an opaque immutable tape hash between the three-token ledger triples is
  an anti-contamination delimiter only: the controller never decodes or predicts it. The candidate has
  no Stokes artifact, SFT checkpoint, GPU allocation, or capability result yet; it is not evidence of
  reasoning or context scaling.

- **2026-07-13 18:15** — **TNDL CPU build/audit is live on Stokes, not Newton.** Stokes default
  `/usr/bin/python3` is Python 3.6 and rejected the repository's postponed-annotation syntax during
  preflight, so both dedicated CPU scripts now pin the verified `/usr/bin/python3.12` interpreter.
  Submission `738430` writes only fresh TNDL artifacts and `738431` is its read-only `afterok` audit;
  both request four CPUs and 24 GiB on `normal`. Their scripts passed remote compilation and Slurm
  `--test-only`; no H100, pretraining stream, checkpoint, or existing artifact path is shared.

- **2026-07-13 18:25** — **TNDL CPU admission completed and is mirrored, but remains untrained.** Stokes
  build `738430` completed in 2m15s and independent audit `738431` in 2m45s. The immutable artifact is
  available through the shared `/lustre/fs1/home/sa305415/shohin` path on Newton and has a verified Mac
  mirror: train data SHA-256 `dd5bcc9768b3b96c6c476333bc57ffd5563afea1b5ed74b416f207e9847f62bc`,
  held-out SHA-256 `9ee78b94ca4798c1cf6e742b561c208b273e33eccb059a2873de1d946fbd0316`, and local/remote
  MD5s `8cdaef594c979cddaeaba766740e4c46` / `ec0ff37b5d4c62e168ba6626a58caa2e`. The auditor confirms
  169,115 valid training rows, 900 valid held-out episodes, and zero invalid, duplicate, missing-context,
  exact-overlap, or 13-gram findings. `eval_token_native_ledger.py` and its unsubmitted one-H100 wrapper
  now measure literal-carrier syntax, exact transition transport, closed-loop answers, and paired
  counterfactual changes; local pure contracts pass. Hash-bound token accounting
  `token_native_ledger_v1_train.token_accounting.json` is local/Newton md5
  `c7ae47c14bf374a85323ba186b459a7a`: all 142,012 transition targets are exactly three tokenizer tokens
  and average 79.246 prompt-plus-target tokens, while the 27,103 source-dropped final readouts average
  166.040 tokens including the repeated opaque audit delimiter. It has no SFT, H100 allocation, or model
  result; wait for the DRS evidence chain before deciding whether it earns a matched comparison.

- **2026-07-13 18:45** — **DRS held-out wording is a decisive negative generalization result.** One-H100
  evaluation `687563` completed from the unchanged DRS checkpoint on 500 independently held-out wording
  episodes and reached only **125/500 final answers (25.0%)**, down from **275/500 (55.0%)** under the
  canonical core prompt. It remains locally/Newton mirrored at
  `artifacts/evals/digitwise_recurrent_v2_sft200k_r3_heldout_p100.json`, md5
  `2d33e3988a2bb42ef3bc10a7f63d4dd1`. First transitions are still often locally plausible (423/500),
  but closed-loop final answers collapse by regime: fit-w4 67/100, fit-w6 28/100, value-OOD-w4 22/100,
  value-OOD-w6 8/100, and width-OOD-w8 0/100. Paired counterfactual answers similarly fall to
  66/25/23/4/0. This is neither a transferable state representation nor workspace evidence: the DRS
  protocol is a narrow, wording-conditioned executor with increasingly fragile recurrent transport.
  `687564` direct raw-versus-DRS interaction is running; its frozen NLL (`687565`) and post-DRS residual
  patch (`687578`) descendants remain serially held. Do not promote DRS, CWI, STRR, or TNDL before those
  diagnostic artifacts are complete and interpreted.

- **2026-07-13 18:55** — **Staged a stricter paper-inspired causal diagnostic without allocating a GPU.**
  `probe_restricted_jacobian_digit_lens.py` is a deliberately limited next-token digit analogue of the
  paper's Jacobian lens, not a claimed reproduction: it averages per-digit gradients from selected
  middle/late block outputs across hash-disjoint held-out DRS episodes, then tests the frozen directions
  on separate episodes by readout and by a two-coordinate residual swap. The swap has a fixed
  shuffled-label control and only compares matched local contexts. Local CPU contracts and remote source
  compilation are clean. A remote CPU import test hit an OpenBLAS allocation failure before its pure
  contract result, and the Slurm `--test-only` query did not return within a bounded minute; both were
  stopped without creating work. Scheduler/runtime admission therefore remains unverified; no model,
  corpus, H100 allocation, or score has been created. It is held behind `687564 -> 687565 -> 687578`:
  use it only if that chain leaves a concrete ambiguity between absent reusable state and a whole-residual
  patch that is too nonspecific. It cannot promote DRS, STRR, CWI, or any reasoning claim by itself.

- **2026-07-13 19:15** — **Canceled one genuinely dead DRS diagnostic attempt without losing evidence.**
  Direct interaction `687564` began on evc49 and wrote its immutable raw/SFT/output binding, but after
  18m46s it had emitted no case-level transcript, used only nine CPU seconds, and wrote no JSON. A
  read-only node check printed the hostname then hung in `nvidia-smi`; this is a node/CUDA failure, not
  a model result. `687564` and its unstarted descendants `687565/687578` were canceled before either
  could write output. evc49 joins the diagnostic exclusion list. `manual_capability_probe.py` now logs
  model-load and every prompt phase; manual/NLL/workspace wrappers now use bounded CUDA preflights,
  conservative BLAS thread limits, and the shared bad-node exclusion list. Local syntax/unit contracts
  pass. Submit a fresh real CUDA preflight before rebuilding the same serial raw-200k versus DRS,
  raw-200k-NLL, and DRS residual-patch sequence; do not reinterpret cancellation as a zero score.

- **2026-07-13 19:20** — **Fresh direct operator interaction confirms the raw 200k model lacks the
  proposed state primitive.** On local MPS, using the hash-verified 200k checkpoint
  (`510d57df578447986b40e20029511b9d`) and three new, non-benchmark source-drop prompts, it failed all
  three: it rendered “3 blue + 4 red = 7 red” instead of compiling `blue=5;red=4`; it answered 10 from
  source-dropped `blue=5;red=4`; and it rendered `5+4=9` rather than changing blue to 7 and total to 11.
  The exact prompts, decoding parameters, and verbatim responses are mirrored local/Newton at
  `artifacts/eval_history/operator_state_reuse_raw200k_mps_20260713.json`, md5
  `5f58d29694cb715f8d6ab9f88a38a86c`. This is qualitative diagnostic evidence, not a benchmark score or
  a claim about one causal failure, but it rules out the hypothesis that raw 200k already performs a
  usable compact semantic state operation hidden by public evaluators.

- **2026-07-13 19:35** — **V9 is fully rejected; V10A is staged as a narrower semantic-primitive test.**
  The completed decision artifact `686947` rejects V9 despite its partial GSM8K lift: its direct interview
  stayed 1/8 with 0 valid state/reuse, its held-out visible trace-and-final score stayed 0/12, and it
  regressed HumanEval. Its semantic-bridge result was only 29/500 answers and 5/500 verified
  trace-and-answer pairs, concentrated in two families. Therefore the prior “wait for V9 decision” gate
  is complete, but a broad V10 mix is not the next scientific question. New unsubmitted wrapper
  `sft_semantic_bridge_v10a.sbatch` trains only the independently admitted 200,000-row bridge corpus for
  one epoch from immutable raw 200k, with current data SHA/report/packing/response-contract bindings,
  bounded CUDA preflight, fresh-output refusal, and conservative learning rates. It is a small-model
  semantic-bootstrapping test, not a broad promotion. It advances only if the family-held-out bridge gate
  and a fresh raw-versus-V10A direct state-reuse transcript both improve; only then may a public board or
  broad-mix continuation be considered.

- **2026-07-13 19:50** — **Semantic-composition transfer gate is admitted on Stokes and mirrored.**
  CPU-only Stokes build `738460` completed in 15s and created an evaluation-only 500-case suite, 100 each
  of product-to-chain, base-then-adjust, verified-fact-to-chain, repair-to-chain, and source-dropped
  named-state regimes. Every target is solver-rendered, and the independent audit found 0 malformed rows,
  response/answer mismatches, duplicate normalized questions, exact training-question hits, or
  question-13-gram hits against the full bridge SFT corpus. Suite SHA-256 is
  `2c80f7eb7b644fefd8bf4699c63c2e174f504d607da94f4c1352f0e4aae65ed8`; local/Newton md5s are
  `0a8b8257ad3a7bf8ad4e944304b382f2` (suite) and `b14e0de24cdfa77ffc32d82772fb26c7` (audit). This
  specifically prevents V10A from advancing on its original family/template-disjoint bridge holdout
  alone. The suite is never an SFT input and does not touch the flagship.

- **2026-07-13 19:55** — **Raw 200k composition baseline is a clean zero.** On the immutable local MPS
  checkpoint, a deterministic 20-case/4-per-family sample of the admitted cross-family suite scored
  **0/20 answers, 0/20 visible traces, and 0/20 trace-and-answer pairs**, with 0/4 in every family. It
  often performed only the final fragment (`262*5=1310`) while ignoring the supplied source-dropped
  inventory, interpreted base numerals as decimal text, and never emitted the required answer contract.
  This exact output is mirrored local/Newton as
  `artifacts/eval_history/raw200k_semantic_composition_mps_p4.json`, md5
  `6118200f1fef077494d0250713034a9a`. It is a small diagnostic baseline rather than an estimate of a
  public score; for V10A it establishes that any genuine cross-family/source-drop gain is measurable and
  must be checked against the full 500-case suite before promotion.

- **2026-07-13** — **CBC CPU candidate is fully admitted, mirrored, and still untrained.** Stokes
  CPU-only job `738468` completed the counterfactual-bisimulation candidate with **16,000** train
  episodes / **256,000** rows and **600** paired held-out episodes (198 length-4, 201 length-8, 201
  length-12). The independent auditor reports zero invalid train rows or held-out episodes, duplicate
  prompts, exact train/held-out prompt hits, or 13-gram split hits. The immutable train / held-out SHA-256
  values are `6013f5118b00c3b88afbe2af892b7e25867a4a5e5a2d1c5882ee635564326c02` /
  `163e60398f239ab4058129ef135350d3d5509ea1dc309417d9f85dabbdf59256`; local and Newton MD5s are
  `c3859b91199725f1eba35c68e4fa279b` / `5e061dbdd7fcab512c369ad7c5e42611`. The controller now measures
  a real cross-world swap using the model-emitted counterfactual terminal state, never a solver repair.
  This is a reproducible context-state candidate, not a model, SFT, reasoning, or context-scaling result;
  it remains held until the raw-versus-DRS diagnostic chain identifies a defensible next control.

- **2026-07-13** — **Staged a prompt-bound post-bridge capsule route; it has not allocated a GPU.** The
  pre-existing semantic-capsule corpus is intact on Newton: 360,000 rows, 3,000 held-out 4/8/12-step
  episodes, 22,899 exact packs, and zero structural, duplicate, exact-overlap, or 13-gram findings.
  Raw and V9 controls were both 0/300 closed loops, so this is not a claim that capsules emerge from
  pretraining. New isolated wrapper `sft_semantic_capsule_v11a.sbatch` refuses raw initialization and
  requires the exact V10A checkpoint plus checkpoint-bound full 500-case bridge and composition results:
  >=250 bridge answers, >=200 solver-derived intermediate-equation contracts, >=25 contracts in every
  bridge family, >=40 bridge answers per family, >=50 composition answers, and >=5 composition answers
  per family. It also independently verifies that
  every capsule SFT row's `completion_prompt` exactly equals the controller prompt before using
  `--prompt-override-field completion_prompt`; this removes the otherwise fatal double `Question:/Answer:`
  boundary mismatch. The held-out capsule evaluator now has the shared CUDA timeout/BLAS limits and bad-node
  exclusion. Local generator/auditor/evaluator/job contracts and remote Slurm `--test-only` passed; no SFT,
  eval, model result, or flagship state changed.

- **2026-07-13** — **V10A semantic-bootstrap chain is submitted but correctly held behind an actual H100
  preflight.** `687684` is isolated one-epoch bridge-only SFT from immutable `best_step200000.pt` to fresh
  `train/sft_v10a_bridge_200k_r1`; it is `afterok:687647`, so it cannot start until the standalone real
  CUDA/bf16 preflight passes. Three read-only children are then independently `afterok:687684`: `687685`
  runs the full 500-case semantic-bridge gate, `687686` runs the full 500-case cross-family composition
  gate, and `687687` preserves a raw-versus-V10A direct transcript at
  `artifacts/eval_history/manual_capability_raw200k_vs_v10a_r1.json`. Each uses an isolated output and
  one H100 with the shared bad-node exclusions; none can alter pretraining weights, writer output, or a
  corpus. This is a primitive learnability experiment. V11A capsule continuation remains unsubmitted and
  may start only after reviewing the complete checkpoint-bound bridge/composition evidence.

- **2026-07-13 19:23** — **Added a cache-native anchor substrate without creating a new memory claim.**
  `train/causal_kv_anchor.py` transports only an exact model-authored token sequence as an immutable KV
  prefix and serially appends later tokens. This model's cache path is only causally exact for a
  one-token append against a past cache, so the module deliberately forbids batched post-anchor appends
  and checks every cached logit against a full replay of identical token history. Its CPU contracts pass
  both full-replay equality and independent reuse of the same immutable root cache for two divergent
  continuations. Deterministic resource accounting now reports exact cache payload bytes, token positions,
  and causal attention query-key pairs per layer: a 3-token anchor plus 3 appends is 6 positions / 21
  pairs cached versus 18 / 52 for full replay, before separately measuring GPU wall time. It has no corpus,
  checkpoint, H100 allocation, semantic score, or context-window claim. It becomes eligible only after
  V10A plus source-deleted semantic-capsule transport are nonzero, and then must pass model-authored
  anchor swap/zero controls and net token/cache/work accounting; external summarization or controller
  state construction is explicitly disallowed.

- **2026-07-13 19:27** — **Counterfactual Workspace Induction now has a semantic-foil protocol, not a
  training result.** `train/counterfactual_workspace_protocol.py` builds one-step reflections from the
  factorized static tape only. Each proposed candidate remains grammar-valid but violates exactly one
  required semantic field: carry, the active result digit, program counter, or immutable tape. The target
  is value-bound (`expected`/`observed` at the active position), rather than a constant legal/illegal
  label. Local contracts independently validate legal successors, all four foil kinds, and terminal
  exclusions. No CWI SFT, H100 allocation, checkpoint, or semantic score exists. Do not submit it until
  STRR has first proven direct state transport and the prescribed syntax-only, label-permutation, and
  equal-compute controls can be run from the same checkpoint.

- **2026-07-13 19:39** — **CWI now has a full CPU-only data admission dry-run, still not a training
  result.** `pipeline/build_counterfactual_workspace_v1.py` derives legal plus one-field semantic-foil
  reflections from the admitted static-tape factor corpus, while preserving semantic,
  label-permuted, and syntax-only response fields for later matched controls. Its independent auditor
  (`pipeline/audit_counterfactual_workspace_v1.py`) reparses each serialized state, rederives its legal
  successor and verdict without importing the builder, checks all prompt/response bindings, full 3,400
  local-context coverage, pairwise held-out base/counterfactual worlds, and split leakage. The complete
  local dry-run produced **682,957** train rows and **52,200** held-out rows with 0 malformed rows,
  duplicate identities/prompts, missing legal contexts, invalid held-out pairs, exact prompt overlaps, or
  13-gram overlaps; it retains **26,100** paired held-out foil worlds. The durable Stokes job wrapper
  requests only 4 CPUs / 24 GB and refuses existing output. It must remain unsubmitted for SFT until a
  positive STRR direct-transport gate identifies a checkpoint that can support the three matched CWI
  controls; this creates no CWI model, workspace, reasoning, or context result.

- **2026-07-13 19:58** — **Raw 200k restricted Jacobian digit lens is negative across four layers.**
  The local MPS diagnostic used the immutable `ckpt_0200000.pt` (step 200,000), 80 hash-disjoint
  discovery gradients (8 per decimal digit), 200 separate held-out readout contexts (20 per digit), and
  20 matched pairs / 40 symmetric causal directions over every five held-out recurrent regime. At layers
  13/17/21/25, exact top-1 digit readout was **20/200** each (exactly the ten-way chance count), while
  mean ranks were only 5.465/5.415/5.380/5.450 against 5.5 chance. Signal-over-shuffled-control causal
  deltas were +0.108/+0.217/+0.240/+0.286 but their descriptive SEMs were 0.252/0.339/0.326/0.330 and
  only 20-21/40 directions favored the signal. Artifact
  `artifacts/eval_history/restricted_jacobian_digit_lens_raw200k_mps_l13_17_21_25_d8_r20_p4.json` is
  local/Newton md5 `d5c61ead369acc0e1fbf0daf6006cb53`. Therefore raw pretraining has no detectable
  reusable, verbalizable next-digit direction under this restricted test. This is not a full J-lens,
  proof of absent distributed/nonlinear state, a workspace claim, or a reasoning score. The exact probe
  should be rerun only after a checkpoint first passes V10A's behavioral semantic-primitive gates.

- **2026-07-13 20:06** — **Recovered the V10A queue after a real CUDA-node failure without touching
  pretraining.** Standalone preflight `687647` allocated `evc45` and printed an H100 inventory but timed
  out in its bounded Python CUDA/bf16 smoke (`FAILED 124:0`) before any model load, SFT, evaluation, or
  artifact write. Its dependency-dead r1 children `687684`-`687687` were canceled with no output. `evc45`
  is added to the shared V10A preflight/SFT/evaluation/direct-probe exclusions and the exclusion is checked
  by local static contracts. Local job-contract tests, shell syntax, `git diff --check`, explicit remote
  output-absence checks, and Slurm `--test-only` all passed. Fresh isolated r2 chain is
  `687726 -> 687727 -> {687728,687729,687730}`: real CUDA preflight; bridge-only one-epoch SFT from
  immutable raw `best_step200000.pt` to fresh `train/sft_v10a_bridge_200k_r2`; then separately dependency-
  held full bridge, cross-family composition, and raw-versus-V10A direct-interaction evaluations. At
  submission only `687726` was eligible. This is a queue recovery, not a V10A model result; capsule/CWI
  remain blocked on the complete checkpoint-bound behavioral gates.

- **2026-07-13 20:08** — **Fresh V10A CUDA gate passed and the isolated bootstrap SFT began.** Preflight
  `687726` completed on `evc48`: `nvidia-smi` reported an H100 PCIe with 81,559 MiB and the bounded Python
  smoke successfully allocated bf16 storage, ran a matrix product, synchronized, and checked finiteness
  (`allocated=37,748,736`). `687727` consequently began its one-epoch bridge-only SFT from immutable raw
  `best_step200000.pt` to a fresh `train/sft_v10a_bridge_200k_r2`. The full bridge, composition, and direct
  interaction children `687728`-`687730` remain dependency-held. This establishes usable diagnostic GPU
  allocation only; it is not a V10A capability score or a reason to unblock capsule/CWI work.

- **2026-07-13 20:10** — **V10A r2 on-node data binding passed before training.** `687727` loaded immutable
  raw `best_step200000.pt` at step 200,000 (125.1M parameters) only after recomputing the frozen bridge
  data SHA-256 `c219cb0a18cc82a2f634d8d1e5d0ad4e9e45233281b3c82d24d19a834aa00907`, all admission reports,
  and the response contract. It reports exactly 200,000 examples, 17,270,366 source tokens, 10,962,976
  answer tokens (63% of supervised tokens), and 8,432 2,048-token packs, all in the sole
  `semantic_bridge` group. This is confirmed input provenance, not a loss/score/capability result.

- **2026-07-13 20:14** — **Strengthened the post-V10A trace gate before evaluation allocation.** The old
  semantic-bridge metric counted a `<think>` tag plus correct final answer as a visible trace, which can
  reward decorative narration. `eval_semantic_bridge.py` now separately reports `trace_contract_correct`:
  the response must contain every solver-derived intermediate equation from the frozen gold trace (base
  conversion additionally requires every place-value equation and its multi-term sum). Focused local
  contracts prove that whitespace-equivalent equations pass while a correct answer with generic narration
  fails. The synced V11A wrapper now requires at least 200 such correct trace contracts and at least 25 in
  each bridge family, in addition to its existing answer/composition gates; it also excludes failed CUDA
  node `evc45`. This changes only pending read-only evaluation and an unsubmitted continuation guard, not
  V10A's training data, running SFT, flagship, or any prior score.

- **2026-07-13 20:15** — **V10A r2 bridge-only SFT completed; capability gates are now running.** `687727`
  completed one epoch on `evc48` with no CUDA/checkpoint/data-contract failure: 527 updates in 282 seconds,
  falling from training loss 1.0546 at update 0 to 0.0126 at update 520, and wrote isolated
  `train/sft_v10a_bridge_200k_r2/sft_ep1.pt`. This is expected narrow curriculum fit, **not** reasoning
  evidence. Its two independent children started from that exact checkpoint: `687728` runs the full
  five-family bridge holdout on `evc29`, while `687729` runs the full cross-family/source-dropped
  composition holdout on `evc48`; both use the new intermediate-equation trace-contract metric. `687730`
  remains resource-pending for the raw-versus-V10A direct transcript. No bridge, composition, or direct
  capability score has completed; V11A, CWI, and anchors remain blocked.

- **2026-07-13 20:18** — **Pre-registered a conditional Interchangeable Semantic Ledger (ISL) ablation,
  without creating data or a model.** The hypothesis is that V10A may learn five family-specific prose
  traces yet still fail composition because no one shared model-authored object is required to cross a
  family boundary. ISL would force natural language to compile into a small exact token ledger, then drop
  the source and require that same emitted ledger to drive two distinct consumers plus paired
  counterfactual swaps. The controller would forward text verbatim and would be prohibited from parsing,
  selecting, repairing, or calculating the ledger. Matched syntax-only, label-permuted, zeroed, and
  mismatched-ledger controls are mandatory. This is neither data nor training: it is the next falsifiable
  branch only if V10A passes its own bridge holdout but fails cross-family composition. If V10A fails its
  bridge holdout, ISL must not be used to hide a more basic language-to-state failure.

- **2026-07-13 20:29** — **V10A r2 is a completed negative result, not a partially successful reasoning
  recipe.** Its isolated bridge-only SFT `687727` fit one epoch from immutable raw `best_step200000.pt` to
  `train/sft_v10a_bridge_200k_r2/sft_ep1.pt` (527 updates, loss `1.0546 -> 0.0126`). Exact training fit did
  not survive independent gates. Checkpoint-bound bridge `687728` is **123/500** answers and **121/500**
  solver-derived equation contracts: base conversion 35/100, fact continuation 62/100, product adjustment
  3/100, state chain 15/100, and trace repair 8/100. Cross-family/source-dropped composition `687729` is
  **4/500**, entirely repair-to-chain; base-then-adjust, fact-to-chain, product-to-chain, and named-state
  source drop are each 0/100. Fresh seven-case direct interaction `687730` is only 3/7 initial, 1/7 review,
  3/7 supplied-fact use, and 1/7 source-state reuse, versus raw 1/7, 0/7, 1/7, 0/7. Reports are mirrored
  locally/Newton with md5 `9f0fae4c22787a96431b74850c25cb1d`,
  `6d073d55325a561b102746ccdccd6651`, and `c69d8ff98a3c76eac4a2496fbe303475`. This blocks V11A,
  semantic capsules, CWI, anchors, and ISL; emitted explanations are not accepted as workspace evidence.

- **2026-07-13 20:29** — **Reduced the next hypothesis to semantic-basis transport, still without a
  model claim.** V10A conflates basic language-to-state compilation with multiplication, base conversion,
  and long family traces. The new CPU-only candidate asks the model to compile two ordinary-language values
  into exact `ledger:P=<integer>;Q=<integer>`, survive source deletion, update P, and service two independent
  consumers (`P-Q`, `P+Q`). Train/held-out values, labels, places, and prompt forms are disjoint. Its builder,
  independent auditor, and Stokes no-GPU/no-overwrite job contract passed locally. It remains data-admission
  only: no SFT can start until a closed-loop evaluator forwards exact model-emitted ledgers and validates
  held-out multi-consumer, swapped, zeroed, and mismatched-state controls.

- **2026-07-13 20:43** — **Semantic-basis transport data is admitted, but remains deliberately untrained.**
  The first full local CPU attempt found a real admission bug before writing an artifact: the original 10–99
  P/Q range allows only 8,100 distinct source-dropped `P-Q`/`P+Q` prompts, not the required 30,000 episodes.
  The generator now samples P/Q without replacement, guards capacity before construction, and uses disjoint
  train 10–199 / held-out 201–299 bands; the independent auditor enforces the same bands. The corrected
  build committed **150,000** train rows and **5,000** held-out rows, exactly five phases per episode, with
  0 malformed rows, duplicate normalized prompts, exact split hits, or 13-gram split hits. SHA-256 values
  are train `e039fc983f78ad1215507659350da54ded4a6494567a347de5f1935e9681d5c0`, held-out
  `b7beb27a2f30f3255f7400791fb1fce8bb5c5d52aeb1c683cb85e7bffa115514`, and audit
  `e14c26ab75f607ea84982f74e885f19642a195b1f48613eae1b7a2985b76ac64`. Stokes accepted the network
  connection but rejects password authentication, so its scheduler was not used and no Stokes job id exists.
  This is an immutable data admission only; closed-loop model-emitted ledger and counterfactual evaluator
  work must exist before any SFT is eligible.

- **2026-07-13 20:59** — **Corrected semantic-basis transport from a formatted-state test to an exact-carrier causal test.**
  Review found that v1's `think + ledger` targets would require a controller to extract or reprint a ledger
  substring, so v1 remains immutable data evidence but is ineligible for a closed-loop claim. Fresh v2 is a
  separate local CPU build: 150,000 train / 5,000 held-out rows, 30,000 / 1,000 complete episodes, with only
  exact ledger targets for compile/reflect/update and exact answer targets for two source-deleted consumers.
  A first full v2 build caught duplicate post-update consumer prompts despite unique source P/Q pairs; the
  generator now fixes each Q's delta within a split, preserving delta diversity while making all updated P/Q
  carriers injective. Independent audit is clean: 0 invalid rows, duplicate normalized prompts, exact split
  hits, or 13-gram hits; train/held-out/audit SHA-256 are
  `4363101c9773b055e24bce3e79f727f3c103a0fb357a6820206ddeab2567234f`,
  `6f7dfdfeffc12ddf1ffcb21c12579009d7c00330cbcef54361ab6c4479972a0c`, and
  `d38f443fb3398b2b647060fdd475821849ab43bc94998839babf251f465eb78d`.
  `semantic_basis_transport_controller.py` and the isolated H100 evaluator/wrapper passed static oracle and
  job-contract tests: raw model text is accepted only if it fully matches the carrier/answer syntax, then
  forwarded verbatim. The evaluator's cross-episode interchange uses a donor's raw model update emission;
  zero and P/Q-mismatch carriers are explicitly evaluator-created controls. No raw evaluation or SFT score
  exists yet, and no flagship path was read or modified.

- **2026-07-13 21:03** — **Exact-carrier raw baseline chain started without touching the flagship.** V2 data,
  controller, evaluator, and isolated one-H100 wrapper were synced to Newton; remote generator, controller,
  and job-contract tests passed under the constrained one-thread BLAS environment, with the same three
  SHA-256 data hashes as local. Read-only H100 raw baseline `687775` is submitted for 100 deterministic
  held-out episode pairs from immutable `best_step200000.pt`; it writes only a fresh evaluation JSON and is
  not an SFT or training job. Immediate local-MPS raw smoke over four pairs confirms the expected negative
  baseline: 0/8 compile correct, 0/8 reflect correct, 0/8 reportability equality, 0/8 update correct, and
  0 strict causal pairs. Verbatim outputs are generic pretraining prose (for example, `The first step is ...`),
  not ledger syntax; report SHA-256
  `9b390f5c2f0d32beb37528e367ef64b16ee739961bc52f1cef692190d300aa8e`.
  This is baseline evidence only: no learning claim, no SFT, and no flagship modification is authorized by it.

- **2026-07-13 21:10** — **Fixed the SFT/evaluator prompt-surface mismatch before GPU execution.** The initial
  raw evaluator submitted as `687775` would have called raw protocol prompts directly, while `train/sft.py`
  trains this data through `Question: <protocol prompt>\nAnswer:`. It was still pending and was canceled before
  allocation, output, or model inference. `eval_semantic_basis_transport.py` now defaults to the exact standard
  Q/A surface and records the chosen prompt mode; direct mode remains explicit diagnostic-only. Both local MPS
  smokes are zero (aligned report SHA-256 `52f235a7c8f363371495dc42d4dedf279f7789f60e175c264b6cec0a915e5ba4`),
  so alignment did not hide an existing capability. Code and v2 data gates were resynced to Newton and passed
  remote static tests. Corrected read-only 100-pair raw baseline **`687790`** was initially pending priority. Separately,
  SFT input admission completed locally: quality and full-text overlap reports are clean, response contracts
  show exactly one 150,000-row carrier group with no `<think>`/answer-marker imitation, and standard-Q/A
  packing is 4,016 sequences with 1.0x replay. `sft_semantic_basis_transport_v2.sbatch` is static-tested but
  remains held until the aligned raw baseline completes and is reviewed; no flagship read, write, or dependency was added.

- **2026-07-13 21:18** — **Made raw-baseline artifact completeness a hard gate.** `687790` was canceled
  13 seconds into launch before an evaluator artifact or model result was accepted, because review found that
  the report retained only aggregate metrics and a small sample of transcripts. The replacement **`687792`**
  is a read-only, standard-Q/A, 100-pair H100 raw baseline from immutable `best_step200000.pt`; it is pending
  resources and writes a fresh output only. Its evaluator now retains every per-pair raw compile, reflect,
  update, consumer, interchange, zero, and mismatch response. No partial or summary-only output can advance
  the SFT gate. `REASONING_FRONTIER.md` also pre-registers two later, conditional mechanisms: a token-matched
  counterfactual-reflection route versus a direct-only control, and reversible semantic checkpoints. Neither
  has data, an SFT job, or any flagship path; both require a positive exact-carrier causal result first.

- **2026-07-13 21:27** — **Counterfactual-reflection protocol substrate is static-tested, still gated.**
  `train/counterfactual_reflection_protocol.py` distinguishes a source-visible direct answer from an
  interrupted reflection target and a fixed-shape neutral continuation. Its future builder must prove actual
  tokenizer-level target-budget matching rather than assuming matching surface text is sufficient. It defines a strict
  post-change `state:P=...;Q=...;D=...` carrier plus source-dropped consumers that can forward only a
  complete model emission by literal substitution. Its deterministic test rejects prose-wrapped carriers,
  malformed forwarding, hidden source insertion, and a state whose time semantics disagree with the prompt.
  It writes no corpus, schedules no job, and has no path to the flagship. The branch remains blocked until
  the full-transcript raw `687792` result and the exact-carrier learnability result are reviewed.

- **2026-07-13 21:28** — **Full H100 exact-carrier raw baseline is complete and null.** Read-only `687792`
  ran on evc37 for 4m17s from the immutable hash-matched `best_step200000.pt`, with exact standard-Q/A
  inference, the admitted held-out SHA-256, 100 deterministic pairs, and full per-pair transcript retention.
  The artifact has all 100 pairs and every normal compile/reflect raw response populated. It reports
  **0/200** normal strict transports, **0/200** compile correctness, **0/200** reflection correctness,
  **0/200** reportability equality, **0/200** updates, **0/100** model-authored interchanges, **0/100**
  mismatch successes, and **0/100** strict causal pairs. The local/Newton SHA-256 is
  `e4a96192abc528bad1a8c7ed4e5f275dc5bdb1080a2ac36a4e65a19026a8067e`. Typical continuations are
  `Question:`, generic explanation, or source paraphrase rather than a syntactically valid ledger. This
  proves only that the raw 200k model lacks the requested interface; it does not establish or refute
  learnability. The one-epoch exact-carrier SFT is now admissible as an isolated learnability ablation.

- **2026-07-13 21:31** — **Launched the single exact-carrier learnability ablation.** `687834` passed
  Slurm test-only scheduling before submission, then started on evc25 with no connection to the flagship
  writer. It reads only `best_step200000.pt`, the hash-bound v2 training JSONL, and four admission reports;
  it writes only fresh `train/sft_semantic_basis_v2_200k_r1`. Startup confirms the exact data SHA,
  150,000 examples, 8,225,832 total tokens, 1,596,943 answer tokens, and 4,016 packed sequences. Its
  first result is an SFT checkpoint only. Public, source-dropped, and causal evaluations must be newly
  submitted after a clean `sft_ep1.pt` exists; no score should be inferred from loss or training completion.

- **2026-07-13 21:36** — **Exact-carrier SFT completed; causal evaluation is live.** `687834` exited
  cleanly after 251 updates in 196s, wrote only the isolated `sft_ep1.pt`, and has Newton md5
  `dfea34f8525d234cce4f3882c986fc61`; its final logged loss is 0.0168. That confirms that the model can fit
  the data surface but proves nothing about held-out state use. Dependency-held `687837` released only after
  that successful exit and is now evaluating the frozen 100 held-out pairs with the same full-transcript
  standard-Q/A evaluator. It cannot write a training directory and has no flagship dependency.

- **2026-07-13 21:44** — **Exact-carrier held-out gate failed despite excellent output-format fitting.**
  Full-transcript H100 evaluation `687837` completed on evc25 in 5m03s and its 504,747-byte local/Newton
  report is SHA-256 `b643241ea154b49482627e9c6c2e73d20ad17b64422cf5341c06702c7327505e`. From the isolated
  one-epoch checkpoint it gets **198/200** exact compile, **200/200** exact reflection, and **198/200**
  identical compile/reflection carriers, but only **23/200** correct updates and **6/200** full normal
  compile-update-two-consumer transports. No pair had two normal strict episodes, so model-authored
  interchange, zero, mismatch, and strict causal passes are all **0/100**. Responses remain well-formed
  (154 incorrect updates are alternate full ledgers; 190/200 difference and 185/200 sum answers are
  wrong numeric answers), which isolates the failure to execution/generalization rather than controller
  extraction. This is a decisive rejection of transferable carrier/workspace claims. Diagnostic `687853`
  is running on train episodes solely to separate in-distribution template execution from the compound
  wording, value-range, and delta-range OOD gate. Counterfactual reflection and reversible checkpoints
  remain blocked.

- **2026-07-13 21:48** — **Train diagnostic localizes the V2 failure to generalization, not evaluator or controller mismatch.**
  Train-only `687853` completed cleanly on evc25 in 6m21s and its full 774,253-byte local/Newton report is
  SHA-256 `b13050b50345834cf0ce861f23facb0c43a3e9753649ee3d0a410001355171ce`. It reaches **200/200** exact
  compile/reflection/reportability, **194/200** correct updates, **160/200** strict normal transports,
  **65/100** raw model-authored interchanges, and **48/100** full causal passes including the mismatch and
  zero controls. Thus `687837`'s **0/100** held-out causal result is not a malformed prompt boundary or a
  nonfunctional literal-forwarding controller. It is a compound OOD failure across independently changed
  wording/labels/domains, P/Q magnitude, and delta magnitude. Do not train another large V2 variant yet:
  first measure a factorial held-out matrix that changes one factor at a time, then only consider a
  factor-specific curriculum if the evidence identifies a recoverable axis.

- **2026-07-13 21:54** — **Admitted and queued the factorized V2 generalization matrix without adding any training data.**
  The first local matrix build was rejected before use because its delta-only shard reused 1,504 exact train
  prompts through post-update consumers; it is preserved under `artifacts/rejected/semantic_basis_v2_factor_matrix_20260713/`.
  The corrected generator excludes every train source P/Q pair *and* every normalized train/factor prompt.
  The admitted language-only, values-only, and delta-only shards each contain 1,000 complete episodes / 5,000
  rows with zero invalid rows, duplicate normalized prompts, train/factor exact-prompt hits, or train source-pair
  overlap. Their SHA-256 values are `482f303465aef45bb3f046ebdb3a1e5f7bc8d24f4ab5bae8973e8dcf9c7f5a3a`,
  `b94119eeb0108cd488e4b407f8c6c89cc32dbd9332ed8c5f66abcc3be1f5f967`, and
  `898b591d43a710a3e8a1ee1415a03782fdfd999b72dff7505ee38a808b8f1c11`; matrix audit SHA-256 is
  `159e951ce3ae558fbd3eb52f81cdfc7ce5c01f5c09a25b813a15a1c63ddc518f`. Same-wording values/delta
  shards intentionally report static scaffold 13-gram overlap rather than disguising it as decontamination.
  Newton hashes and static evaluator contracts match. Read-only serial H100 chain **`687860 -> 687861 -> 687862`**
  scores language-only, values-only, then delta-only from the isolated `sft_ep1.pt`; each writes a fresh report
  and no job reads or writes a flagship output. This matrix is diagnostic-only and cannot promote V2.

- **2026-07-14 01:34** — **Factorized exact-carrier transfer rejects a one-factor explanation.** The three
  read-only H100 evaluations completed from the same isolated V2 checkpoint and are now copied locally with
  hash-bound reports: language-only `687860` is **1/100** strict causal passes (30/200 normal strict,
  115/200 updates; report SHA-256 `c8decf2e0750ca1438434842589c5eab392a7bd8ac1af65f7f67ae7437507ad5`),
  values-only `687861` is **3/100** (61/200 normal strict, 151/200 updates; SHA-256
  `c00b56b3f8bde41e1b8f0d04b1a27d687cb6bd2b48b953df35b5f67f497ad57d`), and delta-only `687862` is
  **2/100** (16/200 normal strict, 18/200 updates; SHA-256
  `e30f9d5301e039aaea1c2bcf6a4806f9ca3c4bcd2730d1874e357971ae83c654`). All three retain 199-200/200
  compile/reflect/reportability, while the train-only diagnostic remains 48/100 causal. Thus V2 learns a
  template-conditioned local executor, not a transferable semantic state. A fresh, isolated
  paraphrase-state-alignment trainer and job wrapper now pass unit, CPU end-to-end, static job, shell, and
  diff checks. Its canary `687871` is bounded to 512 examples, captures a mid-layer prompt-boundary residual,
  and adds only same-ledger compile/reflect alignment to ordinary CE; it cannot write a flagship output.
  Promotion requires matched CE-only and deliberately wrong-ledger controls plus gains on language-only causal
  transfer that survive the value and delta gates. Local Newton DNS was unavailable at this entry, so no canary
  execution result is claimed.

- **2026-07-14 01:43** — **Added a causal activation-exchange audit before interpreting representation alignment.**
  `train/eval_paraphrase_state_causality.py` full-replays every generated token while replacing only the
  selected answer-boundary residual: this avoids a stale pre-patch KV cache and makes the intervention
  interpretable. It compares identity replacement, an independently worded same-ledger reflection state, and
  a different-ledger reflection state. A tiny raw-200k local-MPS smoke (one pair, two directions) is negative:
  baseline/same exact target **0/2**, mismatch exact donor **0/2**, positive mismatch donor margin **0/2**;
  same/mismatch state cosines are 0.9742/0.9714. Its report SHA-256 is
  `544456ebc7a227ed7a9a556c94719dac2d9a933bd48a5b016f494d0a116768c2`. This validates the actual 125M
  model/intervention path but is not a powered capability score. After the alignment canary is verified, score
  all same/CE-only/wrong-state models on 50 pairs; require neutral identity, preserved same-state reports, and
  donor-directed mismatch effects *in addition to* the pre-registered behavioral language/value/delta gates.

- **2026-07-14 01:45** — **Expanded the raw activation null to four independent language-only pairs.** The
  same full-replay answer-boundary intervention reports **0/8** baseline exact target, same-state exact target,
  or mismatch exact donor reports; donor-versus-target mismatch margin is positive **0/8** times and averages
  **-13.5032** log probability. Same/mismatch residual cosine is 0.9747/0.9734, showing no meaningful semantic
  separation at the selected raw layer. Hash-bound report:
  `ac6f42ffa36e089afa2ab2da1a9b9b0087287393ab54e9cb9728b15d5852af60`. This is the local raw reference for
  post-alignment causal audits, not a workspace claim or evidence that the aligned canary will work.

- **2026-07-14 01:51** — **Hardened the alignment trainer and pre-registered a contrastive-geometry fallback.**
  Pair batches now deterministically exclude duplicate ledger targets, preventing an accidental same-state
  mismatch control. Optional same-state InfoNCE (`CONTRASTIVE_WEIGHT`) identifies each compile prompt's own
  reflect state among distinct ledger states and reports positive versus hardest-negative cosine; it is rejected
  for mismatch/CE-only modes and is **not** being substituted into the pending attraction-only canary. All unit,
  CPU end-to-end (same, mismatch, CE-only, and contrastive same), static-job, shell, and causal-audit tests pass.
  Only if the clean same-state arm fails to separate the raw 0.9747/0.9734 geometry and fails its language gate
  may an isolated contrastive arm be run; it must beat CE-only, same-state, and wrong-state arms before
  value/delta scoring. This remains a representation experiment, not a latent-reasoning or context claim.

- **2026-07-14 01:53** — **PSA H100 canary passed, but is intentionally not scored as capability.** `687871`
  completed on evc37 in 1m44s from immutable `best_step200000.pt`. It used `MODE=same`, layer 19,
  alignment weight 0.05, and a bounded 512-row input that packed to 13 sequences, hence only **3** optimizer
  updates at `BS=4`; first logged CE/alignment/total loss was 1.5156/0.0185/1.5166 with cosine 0.9815.
  It wrote only `train/psa_canary_200k_same_r1/psa_ep1.pt` (md5 `4369ce9f6b4fa3e1ff77d91bbff57003`), whose
  metadata records the intended same-state configuration and 30-layer model. No CUDA/OOM/NCCL failure or
  checkpoint serialization issue occurred. Three updates cannot test learning, so the next admitted work is
  exactly three full one-epoch, raw-200k arms: CE-only, same-state, and wrong-state, all with the same packed
  corpus, seed, token/update schedule, and isolated output; then factorized behavioral and activation-exchange
  evaluations. Never promote or touch the flagship based on this canary.

- **2026-07-14 02:01** — **PSA matched causal-control chain submitted after recovered Newton access and remote
  static re-validation.** `688502` is CE-only (`MODE=none`, zero alignment), `688503` is correct
  compile-to-reflect attraction (`MODE=same`, weight 0.05), and `688504` is deliberately wrong-state
  attraction (`MODE=mismatch`, weight 0.05). They are serialized with `afterany` dependencies and each starts
  from the immutable raw 200k checkpoint, same frozen 150,000-row corpus/hash, one epoch, `BS=16`, and
  `PAIR_BS=8`; outputs are respectively `psa_ce_200k_r1`, `psa_same_200k_r1`, and
  `psa_mismatch_200k_r1`. `688502` began on evc33 and its startup line confirms the raw 200k checkpoint,
  CE-only configuration, and isolated output. The remote causal-evaluator tests initially hit a login-node
  tokenizer thread-quota panic; rerunning with `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1` passed, so it is recorded as an
  infrastructure constraint rather than a model/trainer error. All full-arm checkpoints will receive the same
  factorized behavioral and activation-exchange audits before any causal or context claim.

- **2026-07-14 02:14** — **All three PSA causal controls completed; evaluation, not loss, is now decisive.**
  CE-only `688502` finished 251 updates in 159s (checkpoint md5 `c08ad5523488cbbb6713cea835ede59b`),
  same-state `688503` in 188s (`affc7a9f337bb76d905d4c799894fcd2`), and wrong-state `688504` in 187s
  (`defd882b37d639f331ad3d42a801a3e0`), all on evc33 from the immutable raw-200k source and the frozen
  150,000-row corpus. CE loss trajectories are near-identical. More importantly, both same and wrong
  attraction reduced their own pairwise loss to about 0.0002 / cosine about 0.9998. Therefore the alignment
  scalar alone cannot distinguish semantic equivalence from generic collapse; factor-language, values, delta,
  and full-replay activation-exchange controls are mandatory and pending.

- **2026-07-14 02:29** — **Native Residual Relay corpus admitted on Stokes and independently verified on
  Newton.** This is a new, no-extra-parameters alternative to the rejected continuous-memory/CPR branches:
  encode a natural source only through an intermediate layer, carry exactly its final native residual into a
  second source-free suffix pass, and train answer loss there. The CPU builder created 30,000 train rows at
  SHA-256 `bac1e8d041abbfefa892056302a8d78c14abd0d31dd1694e9bc92aefac2fe03c` and 2,000 held-out rows at
  `1d8b633713fff41b331e7c2728e9c0aa3ae307a7b99622c526d99d6dc84120f2`; its report has zero duplicate prompts,
  exact cross-split prompts, or cross-split word-13-grams. Every row has independent same-world paraphrase,
  one-fact counterfactual, source-free event/query suffix, and two query types. This is only an admitted data
  and hard-cut primitive, not a model result; it remains isolated until the PSA behavior matrix is complete.

- **2026-07-14 02:47** — **PSA is rejected by its complete matched causal matrix.** All arms ran 251
  matched updates from raw 200k. On the same frozen language-only 100-pair evaluator, CE-only `688511` is
  **1/100** strict causal passes (report SHA-256 `972ad7be944b305c73e359ceaa7e9efa3d1acd8ee40a5dea41b4ad9171bb6191`),
  correct-state `688513` is **2/100** (`8589b1daa74f05d7ca4970539945e2f9131be46f56ff25fdc92bdfd387026308`), and
  wrong-state `688515` is **1/100** (`610be09f1db163c87c97a3e85d32c0c0aaf6a9c40a8d063c8fe8003d83d2fbf7`).
  The tiny one-pass difference is not credible, especially because all three 50-pair full-replay activation
  audits have zero baseline/identity/same exact target reports, zero mismatch exact donor reports, and zero
  positive mismatch donor margins: CE/same/wrong audit SHA-256 are
  `27fadc76d54a1652ce97b807000d23b62192a0e6ec5341f1975bd383629c41bc` /
  `9b539385caca296f03c47314a57f755ca803853a281df6df0ef10c25747277f1` /
  `7ae7e6244f4bbcde9ed358a654772c48a273a1418358eb866143791231b90e9d`.
  Both attraction modes drove their own training cosine to about 0.9998, proving the loss can collapse
  geometry without creating a usable state. Do not run values/delta or contrastive PSA; advance only the
  separately designed Native Residual Relay hard-bottleneck candidate.

- **2026-07-14 02:43** — **NRR H100 canary passed infrastructure and control-path gates; full depth sweep is
  running.** The no-parameter trainer/evaluator were static-tested, then shared Stokes/Newton artifacts were
  re-hashed to the admitted train/held-out SHA-256 values. A CPU token-shape audit found **60,000** fitting
  source/paraphrase examples, **81** exact-shape buckets, **7,465** full `BS=8` batches, and only **280**
  shape-tail drops. H100 canary `688529` on evc34 ran **12** complete batches from immutable raw-200k in 4s,
  with finite initial loss/gradient/relay norm and wrote only
  `train/nrr_canary_200k_r1/nrr_ep1.pt` (md5 `06a5005489d0609cac2cc7b546fcb17d`). Its dependency-free
  24-row evaluator `688530` completed all normal/paraphrase/counterfactual/zero/shuffle paths and returned
  `0/24`; because those 12 steps are entirely warmup, that is a hardware/evaluator result, **not** a capability
  verdict. Full one-epoch arms `688533` (`L=13`) and `688534` (`L=19`) are independently running from the
  same immutable source with 7,465 updates each; held-out 500-row causal evaluations `688535` and `688536`
  are `afterok`-held. They use separate `train/nrr_*` outputs and cannot touch the flagship. The evaluator now
  additionally records a full-source bypass only to distinguish failure to learn from failure of the hard
  relay; it cannot contribute to a positive causal score. A recurrent native-relay extension remains
  conditional on a material one-step causal success.

- **2026-07-14 03:04** — **NRR v1 depth sweep is rejected; do not build recurrence.** Both full
  raw-200k one-epoch arms completed all **7,465** exact-shape updates: layer-13 `688533` in 1,442s to
  `train/nrr_200k_l13_r1/nrr_ep1.pt` (md5 `f721645e5b5c38622cf2bc55563957b9`) and layer-19 `688534` in
  1,434s to `train/nrr_200k_l19_r1/nrr_ep1.pt` (md5 `1616cf2eb21f656e4e781093fb524dfe`). Each frozen
  500-row held-out evaluation is **0/500** normal, paraphrase, counterfactual, direct-bypass, and strict
  causal; L19 report SHA-256 is `43f583e5e1d9fd51475aefad856bac6b06b62b0b17aa3f3784d8f747c4d4f61f`.
  The relay was physically consequential but not semantic: L13 normal differed after paraphrase/counter/
  zero/shuffle on 275/378/500/500 cases and L19 on 192/355/499/500 cases, yet no counterfactual changed
  the prediction to the correct answer. The L19 in-distribution 200-row diagnostic `688540` rules out a
  simple OOD explanation: normal **21/200**, paraphrase **23/200**, counterfactual **13/200**, direct
  **0/200**, and strict causal **2/200**. The low final NRR loss therefore reflected local output
  regularities and near-number imitation, not an executable compact state. The clean factorized suite is
  retained for audit, but no further NRR or recurrence H100 time is justified.

- **2026-07-14 03:57** — **Counterfactual Residual Algebra (CRA) is the new isolated falsification path.**
  CRA does not add slots, a controller, a parser, a text carrier, or a geometric objective. It exports the
  final five native residuals at a fixed ordinary-token source anchor and requires a source-free tail to
  answer from `Z(donor) + Z(edited) - Z(base)`. The frozen solver-verified corpus was generated on Stokes
  and mirrored to Newton/Mac: **30,000 train** rows at SHA-256
  `e067c2561d397d9e0c44318c5e21d9e50820bd6cd88ccd2513d5b8e2f6e059f5` and **2,000 jointly held-out** at
  `f66536b85cfe2fafa71690a0e3a5a2adc8fb5db0dd5b912ad69f8362c927b248`, with zero duplicate prompts,
  exact cross-split bundles, or cross-split word-13-grams. The H100 canary `688551` on evc34 completed
  12 batches from immutable raw 200k in 7s with finite loss, gradient, tape norm, and checkpoint
  `train/cra_canary_200k_r1/cra_ep1.pt` (md5 `431393f0041673838b04944f71d54ee9`); its 24-row evaluator
  smoke `688553` is 0/24 by design because all updates were warmup. Full raw-200k layer-19 arm `688556`
  is running in isolated `train/cra_200k_l19_r1` with **60,000** normal/paraphrase examples, 8 exact-shape
  buckets, **15,000** updates at BS=4, and no flagship path. The output-only evaluation chain is
  `688557` combined -> `688558` language -> `688559` values -> `688560` delta -> `688561` query ->
  `688562` two-edit; all are `afterok` serialized and write fresh CRA reports. Factor artifacts are bound
  to this exact train SHA: language/value/delta/query SHA-256
  `9d65c670cec5c937d2460986c0168c2733fc016fa8b564e956928553c09361e4` /

  `11d0d98c44b8eaf7701e40f81c83402c22c1f43b79a4970ed5c4fc4b6c9ab97c`; two-edit SHA-256 is
  `7254bd0a857aa27cfb32a323620a7cd6adb46a062c3200a4076d3affae82b560`. Shared wording/state overlap
  in the controlled delta/query factors is reported explicitly; exact source bundles and the required
  unseen world transitions remain zero. **No CRA score exists yet and no recurrence/public-board claim is
  allowed unless the pre-registered causal gates clear.**

- **2026-07-14 04:17** — **CRA now has a checkpoint-bound raw zero floor and a separate likelihood
  diagnostic.** Read-only raw-200k L19 evaluation `688595` completed all 500 jointly held-out worlds:
  **0/500** normal, paraphrase, counterfactual, and strict causal passes; zero and shuffled controls also
  recreated no correct normal answers. This is not a generic-language score: it measures the deliberately
  source-free residual-algebra path, whose raw continuations are expectedly off-manifold. The same raw
  checkpoint's teacher-forced audit `688596` is similarly non-causal: only **1/500** has simultaneous
  normal/counterfactual/paraphrase directional preference and strict control margins. Mean normal
  target-versus-counterfactual margin is +0.0973 NLL, but the required counterfactual direction is
  **-0.0967** NLL; the raw tape slightly favors the normal target regardless of which edit is applied.
  This establishes a clean zero floor rather than a greedy-decoding ambiguity. Added and GitHub-backed
  `eval_counterfactual_residual_algebra_nll.py` / `eval_counterfactual_residual_algebra_nll.sbatch` to
  report the same evidence for the trained checkpoint. `688599` is held after full CRA training and runs
  in parallel with the behavioral chain; its likelihood result remains **diagnostic only**, never a
  reasoning or promotion score. CPU-only `688601` is held after the behavioral, train-diagnostic, and
  likelihood reports; it writes a hash-bound gate aggregation with an automatic reject unless the
  pre-registered combined behavioral thresholds clear. At this entry, full isolated L19 training `688556` is still running,
  most recently through 4,560/15,000 updates; do not infer success from its loss and do not touch the
  flagship.

- **2026-07-14 04:20** — **CRA depth selection is measured, not a blind sweep.** A 48-world raw-200k
  geometry audit compared the same five-anchor residual tape at layers 7/13/19/25. The base-to-edited
  signal grows with depth (3.70% / 8.93% / 15.52% / 17.41% of donor norm), but opposite signed edits
  remain nearly collinear at every depth (cosine 0.9812 / 0.9828 / 0.9855 / 0.9859) and normal versus
  counterfactual composed tapes have cosine 0.999986 / 0.999857 / 0.999561 / 0.999461. Layer 19 retains
  the strongest same-world-paraphrase invariance among the materially sized edit signals (0.9848 versus
  0.9798 at layer 25), so it is the only currently justified full arm. Do not consume another 15,000
  updates on a depth sweep unless L19 creates a real but depth-limited causal signal.

- **2026-07-14 04:31** — **Conditional paired-CRA fallback is staged but cannot run early.** The raw
  geometry diagnosis suggests the core failure mode: opposite `+d`/`-d` source edits are almost collinear,
  so a one-target CE objective can treat them as one response template. `paired_counterfactual_algebra_loss`
  retains the exact same source-free `donor + edited - base` hard cut and adds no parameter, slot,
  controller, parser, or visible thought trace. For each episode it trains both normal and counterfactual
  tapes and requires each tape's own answer CE to beat the paired opposite answer by a fixed 0.2 NLL margin.
  This is a functional causal-discrimination loss, not a hidden-vector cosine objective. Full fallback job
  original `688603`/`688604` chain was canceled while dependency-held after its 3-hour allocation was
  found too short; replacement `688609` is dependency-held after `688601`, with `688610` evaluating it.
  It reads the gate JSON and exits with no output if the first
  CRA arm clears its combined gate; only an automatic first-arm rejection permits the fresh isolated
  `train/cra_paired_200k_l19_r1` run. Conditional evaluator `688610` follows `688609` and writes the
  same fresh 500-world combined behavioral report only when that fallback actually trained. Its
  behavioral/factor evaluation remains required before any claim.

- **2026-07-14 04:33** — **Paired CRA CUDA canary passed and corrected the full-run allocation.** `688605`
  completed its isolated 12-batch raw-200k test on evc41: finite first loss **24.0210**, gnorm **159.494**
  before clipping, normal/counter CE **11.8162/11.0095**, pair margin loss **1.1954**, and checkpoint
  `train/cra_paired_canary_200k_r1/cra_ep1.pt` after 11 seconds. This is hardware/serialization only,
  not a capability score. Its measured ~0.9 seconds/update means a 15,000-update paired epoch needs about
  3.75 hours plus queue/serialization margin; the original 3-hour held fallback could have timed out before
  saving. Replaced it with the five-hour `688609 -> 688610` chain. Never infer capability from the canary.

- **2026-07-14 04:41** — **Paired CRA post-evidence chain is fully conditional, hash-bound, and
  auto-assessed.** After the first-arm CPU gate `688601` rejects, paired trainer `688609` and combined
  evaluator `688610` may run. Only then do held jobs `688616` (teacher-forced likelihood), `688617`
  (language), `688618` (values), `688619` (delta), `688620` (query), `688621` (two-edit), and `688622`
  (200-row in-distribution diagnostic) become eligible; `688623` aggregates them with the same pre-registered
  CRA thresholds. Every paired wrapper first reads the original decision and exits **successfully without
  an artifact** unless it is exactly `reject_cra_l19_r1_no_recurrence_or_public_benchmark`; this prevents an
  ordinary CRA success from producing false fallback failures. The paired factor chain uses the already
  admitted language/value/delta/query/two-edit SHA-256 values recorded above, and the training diagnostic
  binds the 30k-row training corpus SHA. The paired gate is still not a promotion: any result must survive
  behavioral normal/paraphrase/counterfactual, zero/shuffle, all factors, and independent interaction before
  it can motivate another mechanism.

- **2026-07-14 04:45** — **Direct raw-200k interaction confirms a real reasoning deficit, rather than
  merely a benchmark-format deficit.** Fresh local-MPS transcript audit
  `artifacts/eval_history/manual_capability_raw200k_20260714_r1.json` (SHA-256
  `3d995a3f373891b366d7a5b98b0a1d4e026f57f268b0f365c8b6c25f8bbfde02`) ran seven hand-authored tasks,
  each through initial, independent review, verified-intermediate-fact, requested compact-state, and
  state-reuse turns. The immutable step-200k model scored **1/7 initial**, **0/7 review**, **1/7 with a
  supplied verified fact**, and **0/7 compact-state reuse**. The sole initial success was a simple
  syllogism. It multiplied 29×16 incorrectly, repeated the same error under review, and failed to finish
  even after emitting the supplied correct product; it also produced malformed/repetitive state text and
  inverted the requested Python predicate. This is an interaction diagnosis, not a benchmark: it establishes
  that visible CoT-like text or a correct first token is not a functioning workspace. Any CRA result must
  materially improve this kind of source deletion, counterfactual use, and compact-state reuse before it is
  described as reasoning.

- **2026-07-14 04:52** — **Counterfactual Chart Closure (C3) is specified as the next *conditional*
  mechanism, not launched.** If paired CRA produces a sign-sensitive but wording-bound residual edit, C3
  will require two independently worded source charts to compile the same edit operator and will score both
  cross-chart target paths plus a source-free edit-plus-inverse closed path that must recover the donor
  answer. It has no vector similarity objective, added parameter, parser, controller, or visible thought
  channel: only output behavior after native residual compositions is supervised. Its proposed 500-case
  gate is at least 300 strict jointly correct cross-chart/closure cases, at least 350 on each direct path,
  and at most 25 zero/shuffled/chart-mismatched/wrong-inverse recreations; separate factor suites remain
  required. This is intentionally held until paired evidence identifies chart binding rather than generic
  learnability as the failure, and no C3 corpus or GPU job exists yet.

- **2026-07-14 05:00** — **CRA failure taxonomy is available on Stokes for post-report analysis.**
  `pipeline/analyze_counterfactual_residual_algebra.py` consumes only hash-recorded combined, likelihood,
  train-diagnostic, and five factor reports. It can classify no in-distribution primitive, missing
  counterfactual sign discrimination, source-free control failure, cross-split failure, or a tentative
  language-chart-binding pattern. Its recommendations are intentionally narrow: close residual algebra,
  retain paired sign discrimination, conditionally consider C3, or inspect row-level failures. Unit tests
  pass both locally and on Stokes; the script is mirrored at
  `/lustre/fs1/home/sa305415/shohin/pipeline/`. It is diagnostic only and does not change a model, train a
  controller, or authorize a reasoning claim.

- **2026-07-14 05:06** — **Fixed paired-factor split labels before any affected job ran.** Pending paired
  jobs `688617`–`688621` and their gate `688623` were canceled with no allocation, output, or model change
  after audit showed their factor JSONL rows use `factor_language`, `factor_values`, `factor_delta`,
  `factor_query`, and `two_edit`, not `heldout`. Correct replacements are `688626 -> 688627 -> 688628 ->
  688629 -> 688630`, with the paired gate `688631` after NLL `688616`, two-edit `688630`, and the already
  correct 200-row train diagnostic `688622`. Each replacement preserves the original bound file SHA-256 and
  fresh output path. Treat `688617`–`688621`/`688623` as canceled setup, never as failed evidence.

- **2026-07-14 05:10** — **Original CRA taxonomy watcher runs on Stokes CPU only.** Detached PID
  `2699587` (recorded in `logs/cra_taxonomy_stokes.pid`) polls the shared report paths for at most 16 hours
  and, only once all eight original CRA behavior/NLL/factor reports are nonempty, writes
  `artifacts/eval_history/cra_200k_l19_r1_failure_taxonomy.json` using the hash-recording diagnostic.
  Its log is `logs/cra_taxonomy_stokes.log`. It owns no model/checkpoint/data writer and consumes one
  sleeping shell between checks. If the original evidence chain is intentionally replaced, kill this PID and
  update the bound paths rather than letting it classify a mixture of reports.

- **2026-07-14 05:11** — **CRA answer-support geometry is now an explicit interpretation rule.** The
  30,000-row training corpus has **17** distinct normal/counterfactual answer strings across **243**
  target-state/query combinations, with values `[-4,4]` and edits `{-1,+1}`. The 2,000-row jointly
  held-out suite changes language, values, and edit magnitude together; it has **31** answer strings, of
  which **20** are absent from train, values `[-9,-5] U [5,9]`, and edits `{-2,+2}`. Therefore a zero
  combined score alone cannot identify a residual-algebra failure. Language, delta, and query factors retain
  all 17 train answer strings and isolate their named axes; only values also introduces 20 new answers.
  The taxonomy and any next-arm decision must use this matrix rather than treating the joint score as a
  single causal diagnosis.

- **2026-07-14 05:11** — **Ordinary CRA L19 training completed cleanly, pending evidence.** Isolated job
  `688556` completed all **15,000** fixed batches in **4,586 s** on evc35 and wrote only
  `train/cra_200k_l19_r1/cra_ep1.pt` (478 MB, md5 `52ec66d951a28cd22ade37bf35be4490`). Its downstream
  combined behavioral evaluator `688557` began on evc35 and teacher-forced diagnostic `688599` began
  independently on evc40. No score has been read from either job at this entry; the checkpoint is not a
  promotion, and its low training loss is not capability evidence. The original factor/train/gate and
  conditional paired chains remain unchanged.

- **2026-07-14 05:14** — **Ordinary CRA combined held-out behavior is a failed but nonzero signal.**
  `688557` completed all 500 frozen jointly held-out worlds: normal **35/500**, paraphrase **30/500**,
  counterfactual **39/500**, zero control **13/500**, shuffled control **27/500**, and strict causal
  **0/500** (report SHA-256 `6b91aacdf6ee2721bb828dcf1c57270a79ea24c5cf3de6c8623a5b513700cdcb`). It misses
  every pre-registered pass threshold, so it is not a residual-algebra or reasoning result. The matched
  likelihood diagnostic `688599` has positive *mean* normal/counter margins (+0.2409 / +0.1025 NLL) but
  only **12/500** per-example paired-directional and **3/500** strict-directional cases; zero tape has a
  negative mean margin (-0.6256), so the real tape is not consistently necessary. Its report SHA-256 is
  `6dd4bd29ee3b5daaf214a3427b2388843d93e01d8014e0027999a4c67509baa2`. Language and train diagnostics
  are currently running, followed by remaining factors; do not promote or diagnose the failure from this
  joint all-axes result alone.

- **2026-07-14 05:26** — **CRA now has a support-matched value diagnostic, pending execution.** The
  ordinary values factor shifts both source values and answer strings, so its result cannot distinguish a
  failed source-state transport from an inability to emit unseen integer strings. CPU-only Stokes generation
  created a fresh 500-row factor at
  `artifacts/evals/counterfactual_residual_algebra_v1_values_answer_supported.jsonl` (SHA-256
  `cfe048abee712cf0b87014d0be7eb2d8d4c11e9a82b18630061769f05ed12244`). Every source-state number is in
  `[-9,-5] U [5,9]`, while both normal and counterfactual targets use only 9 strings from the frozen
  17-string training answer vocabulary. Its audit SHA-256 is
  `a6b2eaa5a78081513d5c19c8fe42723e3a15f01b312619aa0289a4325f334f2a`; it reports zero exact source-bundle
  or latent-state overlaps with the 30k train corpus. Read-only H100 job `688656` is held after the original
  CPU gate and evaluates only `train/cra_200k_l19_r1/cra_ep1.pt` into a fresh report. It is diagnostic-only:
  a pass isolates numeric output support as the immediate bottleneck, while a failure closes that
  explanation and points to source-OOD numeric transport itself. Neither outcome is a reasoning claim.

- **2026-07-14 05:30** — **CRA L19 is rejected; paired CRA was canceled before it could consume a
  mismatched five-hour allocation.** The completed factor matrix is: in-distribution **102/200** strict;
  language **66/500**; values **0/500**; delta **208/500**; query **116/500**; and two-edit **131/500**.
  The support-matched value control `688656` removes the answer-string ambiguity and is still only
  **48/500** normal, **58/500** paraphrase, **44/500** counterfactual, and **0/500** strict, with
  30/500 zero and 48/500 shuffled recreations. Thus the model cannot transport an out-of-range numeric
  source even when every possible answer string was already trained. Conversely, delta is the strongest
  axis, so the pre-staged paired sign-margin loss does not target the observed bottleneck. The full factor
  taxonomy `cra_200k_l19_r1_failure_taxonomy.json` (SHA-256
  `a1cbc7f8e0b308dcd0dfb5e423a0413207ed64d91e048643bfeb774dc40142a`) diagnoses cross-split
  generalization failure and recommends row-level inspection; `cra_200k_l19_r1_decision.json` (SHA-256
  `8cb3805e45a2f21bdb1179840170249383fbc3a510518767b347bbbd556598eb`) rejects recurrence/public
  promotion. On this evidence, running paired job `688609` would test a sign intervention after sign had
  already generalized relatively well; it was canceled after 3m42s with **no checkpoint**, along with its
  never-started children `688610`, `688616`, `688622`, and `688626`–`688631`. Treat them as canceled
  setup, not negative results. CRA is closed as a direct-numeric residual-algebra route.

- **2026-07-14 05:49** — **Finite-Query Residual Basis (FQRB) data is admitted, but no FQRB model
  result exists yet.** The new solver-derived corpus keeps the exact source-free native composition
  `donor + edited - base`, but one identical source triple is consumed through five independently
  supervised suffixes: `ones`, `tens`, `sign`, `parity`, and `relation`. This makes an edit-insensitive
  answer template insufficient: a group can pass only if the same composed tape supports all five
  finite readouts. CPU-only Stokes generation produced a frozen **60,000-row / 12,000-group** training
  file `artifacts/sft/finite_query_residual_basis_v1_train.jsonl` (SHA-256
  `6d42ce87a202f293b64708e8bbca2193fb90f3cb60c232f6c968b0edaa46f113`) and a **2,500-row /
  500-group** held-out file `artifacts/evals/finite_query_residual_basis_v1_heldout.jsonl` (SHA-256
  `832da1a5264dbd0ec9ccf5b8515276794d545531da5f3dbdacdf4c239452ef97`). Its audit
  `artifacts/evals/finite_query_residual_basis_v1_audit.json` (SHA-256
  `7e4f928b7deca799a15c58a18ad81bef21c503373f874cc69c59279f5423dde4`) reports zero duplicate
  prompts, zero exact train/held-out prompt and 13-gram hits, zero full source-bundle overlap, and exact
  five-row group cardinality throughout. The 13 answer labels are fully present in train and held-out
  normal/counterfactual targets. `train/eval_finite_query_residual_basis.py` scores a whole group only
  when all five consumers survive normal, paraphrase, counterfactual, zero, whole-group shuffle, and
  wrong-query controls. The forthcoming FQRB arm is isolated from the flagship and can establish only a
  bounded causal numeric basis, never general reasoning by itself.

- **2026-07-14 06:00** — **FQRB factor evaluation is pre-registered before the full arm can report a
  result.** After the successful 12-update data/mechanics canary `688663` (12/12 finite updates,
  source-free checkpoint only), full isolated training `688665` began from the immutable raw-200k
  checkpoint. `688666` evaluates the 500-group combined held-out suite after it. Its read-only raw-200k
  floor `688664` runs independently and is not a training dependency. Two additional frozen 500-group
  factors are serially held: familiar-wording, unseen-source-tuple
  `finite_query_residual_basis_v1_core_factor.jsonl` (SHA-256
  `888d18e29740edf4ff1a184ed023debad1715b2610e2e3ec34d871ded4f6abf5`; audit
  `9313bebaa3e338f1859f0eb558dbcd1e9c7dc766beb701ef9aaa7b97afe80e66`) runs as `688668` after the
  combined evaluation; then the three-digit-primary factor
  `finite_query_residual_basis_v1_magnitude_factor.jsonl` (SHA-256
  `3e530f4e8210aa7faf737c5d8a4605d0e899ab38a3d051f1291317ce3c41b452`; audit
  `efa6b8c8470725b7569d0f9724ce609f107f7c59dc8e0fc37eb3d71040f19fb4`) runs as `688670`. The core
  factor intentionally retains train wording and records its expected 13-gram overlap; the magnitude
  factor moves all three **primary** source fields to absolute values 100–997 while retaining two-digit
  secondaries solely to keep the relation consumer counterfactually falsifiable. Neither factor may be
  called a language- or all-field-magnitude result beyond those stated boundaries.

- **2026-07-14 06:18** — **The raw FQRB floor is exactly zero and locally preserved.** Read-only H100
  evaluation `688664` completed the frozen 500-group / 2,500-row combined suite against immutable
  `best_step200000.pt`: normal **0/2500**, paraphrase **0/2500**, counterfactual **0/2500**, and all
  zero, whole-group shuffled, and wrong-query recreations **0/2500**; normal, paraphrase,
  counterfactual, and strict joint groups are each **0/500**. The report
  `artifacts/eval_history/fqrb_raw200k_baseline.json` is mirrored locally and on Newton with SHA-256
  `b68e3b92673e0cca9b94e41bef7f4cd8abda5b17323e5b7d639640f821bb2695`. This is a clean task floor, not
  an indication of future FQRB performance and not a reasoning score. Full isolated FQRB training `688665`
  remains the only active FQRB training writer.

- **2026-07-14 06:28** — **An unseen FQRB two-edit composition factor is frozen but intentionally not
  launched.** The 500-group / 2,500-row
  `artifacts/evals/finite_query_residual_basis_v1_two_edit_factor.jsonl` (SHA-256
  `561d2136a4767c9a280946e0a2228e8dae5daa0f1e2255bc514a3bce9220ed15`) requires the native four-source
  tape `donor + primary_edit + secondary_edit - 2*base`; FQRB training contains no two-edit rows. Its
  audit (SHA-256 `a82f5e6b7f3a230c7b4a60015c69a4d65029bec51bc4be00738a790595390db9`) verifies five finite
  consumers per group, changed counterfactual answers, zero exact one-edit prompt collisions, and records
  familiar-wording n-gram overlap explicitly. The evaluator now supports this mode with the same whole
  group normal/paraphrase/counterfactual/zero/shuffle/wrong-query controls. Do **not** submit it merely
  because it exists: it is a conditional composition gate only after one-edit combined and source-tuple
  transfer evidence pass.

- **2026-07-14 06:34** — **Ephemeral-Codebook Latent Interrogation (ECLI) is staged as a conditional
  late-binding test, not submitted.** `pipeline/generate_ephemeral_codebook_fqrb_v1.py` can derive a
  fresh 60,000-row / 12,000-world FQRB-shaped corpus only after FQRB's combined and unseen-source-tuple
  gates pass. Each source-free suffix carries a distinct arbitrary mapping from the 13 semantic FQRB
  classes to opaque code words; every group shares one table across five consumers, and a same-tape
  codebook-swap control must change the answer. Train/held codebook permutations, full source bundles,
  semantic 13-grams, and exact prompts are audited disjointly; repeated binding-table syntax is reported
  rather than hidden. `train/train_ephemeral_codebook_fqrb.py` and isolated wrappers are mechanically
  checked, while the existing finite-query evaluator now adds codebook-swap correctness to strict causal
  scoring only for rows that carry that field. `pipeline/assess_ephemeral_codebook_fqrb_v1.py` pre-registers
  the 350-per-reader, 300 joint-strict, and <=25 control gate before an ECLI result can be interpreted.
  No ECLI data, model, GPU job, or capability claim exists yet. It is admissible only if FQRB demonstrates
  a bounded multi-reader source-free basis first. The ECLI builder now requires that exact FQRB assessment
  decision at CLI admission and records its SHA-256 in the ECLI audit; the training wrapper independently
  rechecks the parent decision and bound hash before allocating CUDA.

- **2026-07-14 06:40** — **A transcript-first FQRB interview is queued after the existing manual
  comparison.** Read-only job `688687` is held `afterok:688675`, uses
  `train/fqrb_200k_l19_r1/cra_ep1.pt`, explicit bad/live-node exclusions, and the fresh output tag
  `deep_interaction_fqrb_200k_l19_r1`. It runs the longer eight-case five-turn `deep_interaction_audit.py`
  only after the seven-case raw-vs-FQRB manual probe completes. It never writes a model or training path.
  Read the retained responses directly; its score is a diagnosis, not an ECLI or reasoning gate.

- **2026-07-14 06:45** — **The FQRB assessment watcher is Stokes CPU-only and one-shot.**
  `pipeline/watch_fqrb_assessment.sh` waits for nonempty train-diagnostic, combined/core/magnitude/manual
  reports plus the isolated FQRB checkpoint, then writes both the hash-recording assessment and a separate
  source-tuple/language/magnitude/control failure taxonomy. If and only if the exact assessment decision
  admits a bounded FQRB candidate, it may generate the hash-bound ECLI data on Stokes CPU; it cannot submit
  jobs or modify a model/checkpoint. Inspect that decision and the transcript evidence before any ECLI
  training allocation.

- **2026-07-14 07:00** — **Causal Residual Count-Sketch (CRCS) is a new untrained context-scaling
  substrate, gated behind ECLI.** `train/causal_residual_count_sketch.py` deterministically bundles an
  arbitrary number of native event anchor tapes into fixed signed CountSketch lanes from public event
  ordinals, with no learned slot, parser, semantic retrieval controller, or external answer computation.
  Its CPU test verifies deterministic lanes, exact zero/flat-sum controls, event-order sensitivity, and
  differentiable gradients. CRCS is deliberately not a job or corpus: only a passing ECLI late-binding
  result can admit a source-free event-query curriculum with length, collision, sign, shuffle, and
  two-event controls. It must beat a matched flat residual-sum baseline at a fixed lane budget before any
  context-scaling claim.

- **2026-07-14 08:15** — **Phase-Aligned Anchor Tapes (PAAT) is staged as a controlled FQRB failure
  ablation, not a change to the active run.** A direct tokenizer measurement over the first 5,000 frozen
  FQRB rows found base/edited/donor source lengths spanning **20–25** tokens and paraphrases spanning
  **22–26**, with **0/5,000** source triples sharing one token length. Thus current residual arithmetic can
  mix anchor states at different RoPE phases and then decode them at a third phase. The new optional
  `source_window` path right-aligns sources in a fixed zero-embedded positional window and starts the
  source-free suffix at the aligned anchor phase; it adds no token ids, parameters, controller, or source
  content. Defaults preserve the active FQRB path exactly, and CPU contract tests for CRA/FQRB/CRCS pass.
  PAAT may be submitted only if current FQRB fails the combined or unseen-source-tuple gate, using the same
  frozen data, initialization, updates, optimizer, hard cut, and evaluator with `source_window` as the sole
  changed variable. Its checkpoint metadata binds that setting; no current writer has been changed.

- **2026-07-14 08:25** — **FQRB evidence is now parallelized and its passing branch has a one-shot CPU
  admission gate.** Pending core `688668` and magnitude `688670` evaluations were canceled before start and
  replaced by independent read-only `afterok:688665` jobs **688690** and **688691** with their original frozen
  data hashes and distinct output reports; combined `688666`, train diagnostic `688681`, and manual/deep
  transcript jobs are unchanged. `train/jobs/submit_ecli_if_admitted.sbatch` is dependency-held after the
  deep audit. It makes no CUDA allocation itself. It first requires the exact FQRB candidate decision plus
  hash-bound watcher-generated ECLI train/held-out/audit files; only then does it submit one fresh isolated
  ECLI train, dependent evaluation, and CPU-only threshold assessment chain and write an admission JSON with
  all job IDs/hashes. The assessment applies the per-reader, codebook-swap, joint, and control thresholds
  but cannot submit a successor. Original pending gate `688692` was canceled before start after a race audit;
  replacement CPU gate `688695` was canceled before start only to capture the bounded decoding cap; current
  CPU gate **688700** is held `afterok:688687` and waits up to two hours for the FQRB assessment
  and its watcher-generated bound data rather than treating an early transcript completion as a failed gate. A failed or
  absent FQRB admission records a blocked no-op. This removes idle time without allowing a failed primitive
  to consume an ECLI GPU allocation.

- **2026-07-14 08:45** — **Read-only causal evaluation generation caps were tightened from tokenizer
  evidence, not score tuning.** Every normal/counterfactual FQRB response in all three frozen 500-group
  factors is exactly **3 or 5** tokenizer tokens, so pending combined/core/magnitude jobs `688666/688690/688691`
  were canceled before start and replaced by `688696/688697/688698` with `MAX_NEW=6`. This retains a one-token
  margin above every valid completion but avoids up to six useless tail passes per decode. ECLI codes are
  uniformly three tokens; its future evaluator now receives `MAX_NEW=4`. PAAT inherits the six-token FQRB
  cap. These limits affect only when greedy decoding stops, never the frozen target, source tape, controls,
  or scoring predicate.

- **2026-07-14 08:50** — **Local FQRB disaster-recovery mirror is armed.** `pipeline/mirror_fqrb_checkpoint.sh`
  runs locally in detached screen session `shohin_fqrb_mirror` (the initial shell child did not persist), polling the isolated remote
  `train/fqrb_200k_l19_r1/cra_ep1.pt` for up to six hours. On appearance it copies to the local isolated
  `train/fqrb_200k_l19_r1/cra_ep1.pt.part`, verifies SHA-256 against Newton, atomically promotes it, and
  writes `cra_ep1.mirror.json`. It never writes Newton or touches a live training directory.

- **2026-07-14 08:35** — **PAAT has an equally narrow conditional failure branch.** Dependency-held CPU
  gate `submit_paat_if_fqrb_transport_rejected.sbatch` waits for the bound FQRB assessment and taxonomy.
  It can submit the fresh `fqrb_200k_l19_phase_r1` arm only when the original train primitive passes,
  combined/core controls remain clean, and combined or unseen-source-tuple transfer fails. A positive FQRB
  candidate, a missing primitive, or control leakage produces an auditable no-op. The submitted PAAT arm
  fixes `SOURCE_WINDOW=26` (the measured full-corpus source maximum), with all other FQRB data, init,
  BS=4, epoch/update schedule, hard source cut, and evaluator settings unchanged. Its combined/core/magnitude
  factors run in parallel and it receives the same raw-vs-candidate and deep transcript audits. CPU gate
  `688694` was canceled before start only to capture the bounded decoding cap; current CPU gate **688699** is
  held `afterok:688687`. No generic residual-algebra retry is authorized.

- **2026-07-14 09:00** — **CRCS curriculum generation is now reproducible but remains ECLI-gated.**
  `pipeline/generate_causal_residual_count_sketch_v1.py` accepts only a parent assessment with decision
  `bounded_ecli_late_binding_candidate`; otherwise it refuses to write anything. Its intended first run is
  12,000 four-event training histories and 500 held-out eight/sixteen-event histories, five consumer rows
  per history, at a fixed 4x4 signed sketch geometry. Every row holds an ordinary source-free suffix with
  a fresh opaque codebook plus independently solver-derived event-edit and codebook-swap targets. The
  builder requires zero exact history, codebook, and semantic 13-gram train/held-out overlap and rejects
  answer-invariant interventions. `train/test_generate_causal_residual_count_sketch_v1.py` confirms both
  the parent-admission refusal and the small split audit. This is CPU-only research staging: no data was
  materialized, no CRCS job was submitted, and no context/reasoning claim is open.

- **2026-07-14 09:00** — **Isolated FQRB writer 688665 remains finite and stable on evc35.** It reached
  step 19,200 / 29,890 at roughly 6 seconds per 20 steps with finite loss, gradient norm, and tape norm.
  The only valid next evidence remains the dependency-held train diagnostic, three capped frozen factors,
  manual comparison, deep transcript, watcher assessment, and then exactly one of the ECLI or PAAT gates.
  Do not infer causal transport or reasoning from this training trace and do not modify the writer.

- **2026-07-14 09:10** — **Counterfactual Workspace Reflection (CWR) is registered as a later direct-transfer
  test, not an SFT job.** The workspace-circuits result motivates a falsifiable Shohin-specific hypothesis:
  after a positive FQRB + ECLI chain proves a reportable latent carrier, train only an appended interrupted
  reflection of a source-visible FQRB task (loss never touches the ordinary direct answer), then evaluate
  the uninterrupted direct answer on held-out source bundles, wording, templates, and source edits. CWR
  must beat a matched wrong-world reflection placebo and retain source-change/shuffle/zero causality; it
  also has to improve the existing seven-task direct transcript audit without any reflection prompt. If
  the FQRB/ECLI prerequisite fails, CWR is blocked. No data or GPU job exists yet.

- **2026-07-14 09:20** — **The ECLI-to-CRCS continuation is now CPU-only and one-shot.**
  `pipeline/watch_ecli_crcs_admission.sh` waits for
  `ecli_fqrb_200k_l19_r1_assessment.json`. It writes a hash-recorded blocked no-op for any non-candidate
  decision, and only for `bounded_ecli_late_binding_candidate` may it invoke the CRCS builder. It
  independently rechecks the completed builder audit and writes `crcs_v1_admission.json` with immutable
  hashes. It has no Slurm submission command and cannot allocate a GPU. The watcher is appropriate for a
  Stokes CPU screen session while the conditional ECLI chain runs; it is now running as
  `shohin_ecli_crcs_watch` (screen PID `3034774`) with output at
  `logs/ecli_crcs_watch_stokes.log`. A CRCS *model* experiment is still explicitly unsubmitted.

- **2026-07-14 09:50** — **FQRB writer completed; direct-transfer evidence is negative, and the missing
  factor scores were repaired without changing a model or dataset.** Isolated writer `688665` completed
  all **29,890** updates and wrote `train/fqrb_200k_l19_r1/cra_ep1.pt`. Its SHA-256 is
  `d732963dde59e224c6f494b503e54a57ec9a81d4b2b1b586a9d212a7095a1c6d`, matching the local isolated
  DR copy and mirror record. The seven-case raw-versus-FQRB manual report is locally mirrored with
  SHA-256 `18af73e38c28cd3a1e80f7159e70a1de74d651f255cda70c3d1969e94d2e836d`: raw 200k is **1/7**
  initial, **0/7** review, **1/7** verified-fact use, **0/7** compact reuse; FQRB is **0/7** on all four
  modes. The FQRB outputs are repetitive label-token fragments (for example `positivelessless...`), so
  this is a direct behavioral regression, not a hidden-reasoning claim. Original core/magnitude jobs
  `688697`/`688698` failed before scoring because the frozen factor files label their rows
  `factor_core`/`factor_magnitude`, while those jobs requested `heldout`; no report was written and no
  model/output was modified. `train/jobs/submit_paat_if_fqrb_transport_rejected.sbatch` now uses the
  correct split labels for any future PAAT factor jobs. Read-only replacement evaluations **`688737`**
  (core) and **`688738`** (magnitude) bind the same checkpoint, immutable data hashes, group count, and
  six-token decode cap. Combined `688696`, train diagnostic `688681`, and deep transcript `688687` remain
  independent. Do not admit PAAT, ECLI, CWR, or CRCS unless the completed assessment still supplies the
  required bounded primitive evidence; the direct transcript alone already blocks any reasoning claim.

- **2026-07-14 10:05** — **Automatic late-binding continuation now requires ordinary decode health.**
  The completed raw-versus-FQRB and eight-case deep transcripts show that all-parameter FQRB tuning can
  make the model emit the tiny synthetic answer alphabet on ordinary language (for example,
  `positivelessless...`). A local checkpoint comparison confirms that this is broad parameter drift, not a
  prompt parser issue: the tied token embedding/output matrix moved by **18%** of its raw norm, while the
  largest relative changes are in early attention and normalization parameters. Therefore
  `assess_finite_query_residual_basis_v1.py` records `direct_decode_preserved` and admits ECLI only when
  the candidate does not regress on the raw model's initial-answer and supplied-fact counts. This is a
  non-regression safety gate, not a seven-case reasoning score. It prevents a narrow latent-label result
  from automatically consuming a GPU as a purported reasoning continuation after global decode collapse.
  The tested watcher copy on Stokes must use this policy before it writes the one-shot assessment.

- **2026-07-14 09:02--09:05** — **FQRB is closed after the full causal matrix; the next overnight
  experiment is direct and behavior-preserving.** The completed combined report is only 7/2,500 normal,
  4/2,500 paraphrase, and 16/2,500 counterfactual rows with 0 strict groups. In-distribution diagnostic
  behavior proves why this cannot be promoted: zero tape recreates 500/500 normal answers and shuffled
  tape recreates 466/500. Core and magnitude factors retain 0 strict causal groups; magnitude's ordinary
  labels remain recognizable, but its source-state counterfactuals are not. The direct seven-case and
  eight-case transcripts independently show a total loss of normal language behavior. PAAT admission
  `688742` wrote the decode-regression blocked no-op, ECLI timed out without an artifact, and no
  FQRB-dependent successor is allowed. Rather than repeat another hidden-carrier format, committed
  `6ca1e95` adds a generic direct-SFT control: freeze the tied lexicon/output matrix and regularize the
  remaining trainable model against raw next-token logits on answer-free prompts. Stokes CPU job `738692`
  built `prompt_replay_v1.jsonl` from frozen broad-v4 plus primitives; it has 4,096 rows, SHA-256
  `d9c3c355b5fba6b9643d052203ed5d3339dab67563bd8071ba11f12b31076b60`, no target answers, and zero exact
  prompt overlap with the primitive and RG held-outs. Isolated H100 SFT `688748` writes only
  `train/sft_retention_v1_200k_r1`; its dependency-held evidence is primitive `688749`, balanced RG
  `688750`, raw-vs-candidate interaction `688751`, and deep transcript `688752`. This is an overnight
  falsification run: promotion requires preserved direct output plus improvement on disjoint arithmetic,
  base conversion, and procedural reasoning, not merely a lower SFT loss or a synthetic contract score.

- **2026-07-14 09:05** — **Flagship naturally handed off and stays hands-off.** One-H100 `685084`
  reached the 200k milestone then expired normally. Two-H100 continuation `686732` is running on evc34,
  using `NG=2 BS=32 ACC=4` and the same 524,288-token update; it is healthy through observed step 227,490
  at about 287.2k tok/s. Brief clustered gradient-norm skips recovered without intervention. Capability
  jobs use fresh isolated paths and must not write, mount, or alter the active pretraining output.

- **2026-07-14 09:28** — **The retention experiment's measurement path was repaired before a
  capability result could be created.** Legacy primitive V1 held-out rows have `question`/`answer` fields
  rather than explicit `completion_prompt`/`contract` fields. Initial raw primitive `688757` therefore
  failed without an artifact, and replacement `688759` showed that adding only the default contract was
  insufficient (`no valid contract rows`). `train/eval_contract_primitives.py` now resolves the exact SFT
  inference boundary `Question: <question>\\nAnswer:` and defaults legacy rows to the ordinary `answer`
  contract; the checked local reader resolves all 700 requested rows. A separate audit found that selecting
  the first shuffled 700 of a 3,500-row primitive set would make family coverage order-dependent, so the
  final primitive gate is `688768 -> 688769` with exactly 100 held-out rows in each arithmetic,
  base-conversion, correction, sort/unique, state-update, string-insert, and syllogism family. Raw RG
  `688758` was canceled after evc26 reported CUDA unavailable and began CPU decoding; the RG, primitive,
  and deep-interaction wrappers now require a real bf16 CUDA allocation and exclude audited bad nodes.
  Valid raw RG `688761` is running on evc35, retention SFT `688748` is finite/stable through 2,840/4,511
  updates on evc25, and the only later jobs are the dependency-held candidate evaluations and one CPU-only
  decision record `688770`. No model or data has been promoted from these corrections.

- **2026-07-14 09:36** — **A direct-skill improvement cannot be mistaken for reasoning without
  model-authored intermediates.** The existing twelve-case visible-thinking audit requires both explicit
  `<think>` tags containing the correct requested intermediate values and the correct final answer. It is
  decontaminated against both retention SFT sources: broad-v4 has 0 exact or 13-gram hits in 643,595 rows
  (audit SHA-256 `a2d8e1750cd0e69df2032ff5407afc60a4c13a57bf967823cf98a7be8234b9a7`) and primitives has
  0 hits in 210,000 rows. The H100 wrapper now requires an actual bf16 CUDA allocation and excludes audited
  bad nodes. Raw `688774` and candidate `688775` are held as read-only matched audits; revised CPU-only
  assessor `688776` can issue its already narrow signal only when ordinary direct decoding is preserved,
  balanced primitive and RG gains clear, arithmetic/base operations clear their floors, and the candidate
  has at least one additional verified trace-and-final pair versus raw. This remains a bounded visible
  reasoning signal, never general intelligence or a flagship-promotion condition.

- **2026-07-14 09:39** — **Behavior-preserving SFT fit completed; all claims remain gated.** Isolated
  `688748` completed one epoch in 4,511 updates / 1,766 seconds and produced
  `train/sft_retention_v1_200k_r1/sft_ep1.pt` (SHA-256
  `46970cdc8692787fe78499bc4a8c7d8b7bd4f3a4b9d29408dd8a14a670f53404`). Its metadata binds raw-200k
  initialization/reference SHA `675af7cffdc87ccd43c56a15f0616d368442aad56deb0df3fe11b5a5064aac2a`,
  broad-v4/primitives data hashes, frozen lexicon, 4,096 replay prompts, replay weight 0.25, and
  35/30/20/10/5 math/primitives/procedural/code/teacher sampling weights. Candidate primitive, RG,
  manual, late-lens, and visible-trace evaluations started only after exit 0 and write no training output.
  Raw visible-thinking control `688774` is complete at 0/12 tags, verified traces, answers, and joint
  trace-and-final pairs; its locally mirrored report SHA-256 is
  `a6d297c1f2097a32482e69e428d22142840d79ec528144932448b1cbb04f958b`. The candidate has no result yet.

- **2026-07-14 10:04** — **The behavior-preserving retention candidate is a real narrow trace result but
  fails its pre-registered general-operation gate.** The frozen one-epoch checkpoint
  `train/sft_retention_v1_200k_r1/sft_ep1.pt` (SHA-256
  `46970cdc8692787fe78499bc4a8c7d8b7bd4f3a4b9d29408dd8a14a670f53404`) increased the balanced
  800-row Reasoning-Gym score from **31/800 = 3.875%** to **143/800 = 17.875%**, and the fixed
  12-case visible trace audit from **0/12** to **3/12** verified trace-and-final pairs. Its fresh
  post-freeze state OOD control is raw **0/72** versus candidate **6/72**, concentrated in
  subtract-multiply-add. The raw/candidate direct transcript is only 1/7 versus 2/7 initial and has
  no reliable compact-state reuse. Crucially, the exact balanced 700-row primitive gate gives only
  **7/100 arithmetic** and **2/100 base conversion**, below the immutable 10% floors; the CPU
  assessment `sft_retention_v1_200k_r1_assessment.json` therefore records
  `reject_retention_candidate`. The meaningful observation is that the candidate often preserves
  numbers while substituting an incorrect operation, so this is an operator-to-state binding failure,
  not evidence of broad reasoning.

- **2026-07-14 10:12** — **A new factorized operator-trace test is admitted only as an isolated falsification
  experiment.** The first generated v1 corpus was preserved but rejected before GPU use after its
  13-gram audit found 23 overlaps with the prior state OOD wording. The decontaminated v2 corpus has
  **222,409** unique solver-derived rows (SHA-256
  `31affcc78a7b446360eb71db1d440a02c4b11fe3b033e7f2375da571080e4017`) and a 900-case factorized
  evaluation (SHA-256 `3371e062fd9a46a951c328b54411c8ecf263f8f44885dfaf8939d5cd6c22f035`): 300
  wording-only, 300 value-only, and 300 combined wording/value cases over three operation families.
  Its quality audit has 0 malformed/missing/duplicate/public-eval overlaps; fixed-trace and prior-OOD
  audits have 0 exact and 13-gram hits; wording/full factor regimes have 0 exact and 13-gram hits.
  Value-only deliberately reuses the language templates but has 0 exact prompts, so it isolates numeric
  transfer rather than claiming lexical novelty. The corpus contains direct single-problem traces plus
  minimal pairs that change exactly one add/subtract operator; it is not a hidden controller or an
  alteration to pretraining.

- **2026-07-14 10:16** — **Operator-trace SFT and its entire read-only gate chain are live and
  pre-registered.** Isolated H100 job `688797` on evc28 starts from the retained checkpoint, freezes the
  tied lexicon, applies prompt-only KL against that same retained checkpoint, and writes only
  `train/sft_operator_trace_v2_from_retention_r1`. It has 17,819 exact 2,048-token packs / 1,114
  updates for one epoch; no flagship path is referenced. Baseline factor audit `688798` evaluates the
  retained checkpoint. After a successful SFT exit, `688800` factorized traces, `688801` fixed traces,
  `688802` prior state OOD, `688803` balanced primitives, `688804` RG, `688805` verbatim manual
  comparison, and `688806` deep interaction run as separate read-only jobs. CPU-only `688807` can only
  write `sft_operator_trace_v2_from_retention_r1_assessment.json`; acceptance requires improvement in
  wording, value, and full factor regimes, every operation cell, arithmetic/base floors, direct/RG
  non-regression, and fixed-trace non-regression. It cannot submit a successor or modify the flagship.

- **2026-07-14 10:45--11:02** — **COTA is closed as a full-strength operator-trace recipe; the failure
  identifies an actionable response-mode confound.** `688797` did learn the narrow state-update surface
  (**97/100**), but the independent primitive report is **0/100 arithmetic**, **0/100 base conversion**,
  **90/100 correction**, **0/100 sort**, **97/100 state update**, **0/100 string**, and **27/100
  syllogism**. Its completed RG report is **58/800 = 7.25%**, a 10.625-point regression from retained
  SFT's 143/800. Fixed visible trace-and-final pairs fall **3/12 -> 0/12**. Direct inspection is decisive:
  the candidate emitted `Problem A` / `Problem B` or `The answers are A=` on 11 ordinary direct prompts,
  including arithmetic and base conversion; initial direct accuracy falls 2/7 -> 1/7. This is not latent
  reasoning failing a narrow benchmark. It is a learned paired-answer response mode interfering with
  ordinary decoding. `688830` re-runs the formerly timed-out 900-case factor audit with a one-hour limit;
  `688831` remains dependency-held to write the hash-bound rejection. Neither can promote a model.

- **2026-07-14 10:50--11:02** — **The follow-up changes one causal variable: paired response grammar.**
  Full-strength COTA trained direct and minimal-pair rows together. CPU-only Stokes job `738713` now freezes
  a broad retained-anchor mix that excludes the 59,943 `minimal_pair` rows while retaining the direct
  single-problem traces and broad-v4/primitives anchors. The prior broad staging candidate was rejected
  before any GPU use when a complete consumed-field overlap audit found 4,451 completion-side evaluation
  13-gram overlaps that prompt-only filtering missed. `c74619f` filters question, response, and
  completion prompt. New `197137d` adds `audit_operator_trace_directness.py`: the frozen mix must bind its
  data hash, contain only `direct` operator rows, and have zero paired-answer markers in all SFT-consumed
  fields. `3b124fd` makes future seven-case direct transcripts record the same leakage automatically.
  The broad direct-only SFT wrapper independently validates structural, full-text, trace, OOD, factor, and
  directness reports before a CUDA allocation. No direct-only model exists yet.

- **2026-07-14 11:17--11:23** — **COTA's last missing factor record is now complete, and it makes the
  diagnosis sharper without changing the rejection.** `688830` completes all 900 cases: retained
  baseline is 0 joint in each regime; COTA reaches wording **75/300**, value **32/300**, and full
  **16/300** trace-and-final pairs. That clears the regime-gain thresholds but fails the required
  all-nine-cell floor (double-add-divide is 0/100 full and 1/100 value). More importantly, COTA remains
  0/100 arithmetic and base conversion, regresses RG 143/800 -> 58/800, regresses fixed trace 3/12 ->
  0/12, regresses direct initial accuracy 2/7 -> 1/7, and leaks paired-answer grammar. The first assessor
  `688831` failed before reading evidence due a stale retention-RG filename. Read-only replacement
  `688850` uses the corrected immutable `sft_retention_v1_200k_r1_rg_heldout_688762.json` path and writes
  `sft_operator_trace_v2_from_retention_r1_assessment_688845.json`: all safety gates except aggregate
  factor gains are false, including the newly formal paired-response gate. COTA is closed.

- **2026-07-14 11:19--11:23** — **Direct-only broad anchor is admitted and fitting under a pre-registered
  evidence chain.** The Stokes `738713` source-split build completed all content audits before correctly
  failing the now-obsolete 200k minimum at its final shell check. Its immutable outputs are still valid:
  931,348 rows, data SHA `1a6a8402052bc78040daf29a03e2a2dca6e26a30bb93bb6b6b9d68f0a1268bde`, zero structural
  failures, zero public-eval full-text hits, zero fixed-trace/OOD/factor overlaps, 59,943 excluded minimal
  pairs, and 84,713 hard public-eval ngram drops. CPU-only `738721` adds the missing directness report:
  162,466 direct operator rows, no other contract, and zero paired-answer markers. H100 `688858` then
  passed its independent wrapper admission on evc22 and starts one isolated epoch from the retained SFT.
  `688859`--`688866` are dependency-held read-only evaluations; no job may write a flagship path or submit
  another training successor. The public board remains blocked until the held-out operational gates pass.

- **2026-07-14 11:28--11:41** — **Direct-only anchor fit cleared its real startup health gate.** `688858`
  completed TorchInductor startup without error, then reported finite step-0 loss **0.5368** (supervised
  **0.5367**, replay KL **0.0003**). It is stable through step **460/4,943**: observed losses remain
  finite (0.1864--0.5728) and replay KL small (0.0020--0.0049) under the frozen reference. The allocated
  H100 is now **100% utilized** at 31.4/81.6GiB, so the apparent startup pause was compiler work rather
  than a CPU fallback or a failed fit. This is only a mechanics/admission result: the isolated checkpoint
  remains unpromoted until its fixed-trace, factor, OOD, primitive, RG, and direct behavioral gates pass.

- **2026-07-14 11:45** — **A conditional numeric-reflection control is prepared, but no new fit has
  been authorized.** `pipeline/generate_operator_counterfactual_reflection_v1.py` creates matched
  source-visible auxiliary arms for the direct operator curriculum: one requires the exact state after a
  single counterfactual operation, while the other retains the same operation labels and fixed-width
  reflection format but replaces both state fields with zeros. Both are evaluated only on ordinary,
  unreflected direct prompts. This is a direct operator-semantics test inspired by counterfactual
  reflection, not a revival of the failed source-dropped carrier/workspace routes. It is conditional on
  the direct-only anchor preserving direct behavior and showing a bounded signal; it has no H100 job,
  checkpoint, data artifact, or flagship reference yet.

- **2026-07-14 12:00--12:03** — **Direct-only anchor fit completed; first behavioral evidence is
  negative.** H100 `688858` completed its isolated epoch in **1,961s / 4,943 updates** from retained
  `sft_ep1`, writing `train/sft_operator_trace_anchor_direct_v3_200k_r1/sft_ep1.pt` (SHA-256
  `344f53b27b0bb23524609f31b2b8bb95f701cbef1084a90a5947d25f31a3f3ca`). Fixed visible-trace audit
  `688859` emits `<think>` tags on **12/12** prompts but scores **0/12** correct traces and final
  answers. Eight-case deep interview `688865` is **3/8** initial, **3/8** review, **2/8** scaffold,
  and **1/8** compact reuse; successes are restricted to a trained-style state transition, simple logic,
  and precedence correction. Factor `688860`, state OOD `688861`, primitives `688862`, RG `688863`,
  paired manual transcript `688864`, then CPU assessor `688866` remain read-only and decide the formal
  result. No public board or successor is authorized from this checkpoint.

- **2026-07-14 12:00--12:03** — **The first numeric-reflection/control dataset is rejected at CPU
  admission, as intended.** Stokes `738748` produced immutable r1 reflection/neutral arms (57,602 rows
  each) but its reflection arm has **586** 13-gram hits against the 72-case state-OOD suite. Preserve
  r1 as rejected forensic evidence; do not edit or use it. Commit `f7d27e9` moves fixed-trace, state-OOD,
  and 900-case factor filtering into construction. Stokes `738752` is building a fresh r2 prefix CPU-only.
  It must pass independent semantic, public consumed-field, and all three held-out overlap audits. Even
  an admitted r2 cannot receive a GPU SFT unless the direct-only candidate's complete behavioral gates
  turn positive.

- **2026-07-14 12:03--12:20** — **Direct-only COTA is formally rejected and the clean reflection
  control remains dormant.** All read-only children `688859`--`688866` completed. The candidate's one
  real broad gain is balanced RG **143/800 -> 173/800**, but every mechanism-critical gate fails:
  fixed trace-and-final **3/12 -> 0/12**, state OOD **6/72 -> 4/72**, direct initial accuracy **2/7 ->
  1/7**, arithmetic **8/100**, base conversion **3/100**, and only **14/300** full factor trace-and-final
  cases. The factor matrix still has 0/100 full double-add-divide. Assessor `688866` therefore records
  `reject_operator_trace_candidate`. Filtered CPU r2 `738752` is independently clean at 57,015 matched
  rows per reflection/neutral arm, equal response lengths, fixed prompt-token delta -8, and zero public,
  fixed-trace, state-OOD, or factor-900 overlap. Because the direct prerequisite failed, no reflection
  SFT will be submitted.

- **2026-07-14 12:20--12:35** — **Verbalizable Recurrent Workspace is the next bounded architecture
  hypothesis.** `train/causal_recurrent_scratch.py` adds a frozen-base, source-visible recurrent adapter:
  four shared 96-wide slots at layer 19, four state updates, and a top-8 token-unembedding-aligned
  readout behind an exactly zero-initialized scalar gate. The source remains in the transformer context;
  scratch construction is causally restricted to prompt positions. A matched reset arm has the same
  initialization, examples, optimizer, parameters, and four connected cell executions but cannot
  accumulate across steps. The evaluator now binds each arm to its trained recurrence mode and applies
  disable, one-step, reset, zero, and shuffle interventions. Local syntax and CPU contracts pass. The
  locked NLL gate requires recurrent-over-reset fit/depth gains, within-model recurrence necessity,
  state necessity, and exact-sequence wins before any autoregressive or manual reasoning claim.

- **2026-07-14 12:35--13:08** — **The bounded VRW canary is complete and rejected by every locked
  gate.** Recurrent `688942` completed on evc35 in 1,024 updates / 78 training seconds. Reset attempts
  `688943` on evc37 and `688948` on evc38 were infrastructure non-results: the first exited 75 and the
  second was canceled after a dead CUDA preflight before either created an output directory. Pinned
  replacement `688952` completed on the validated evc35 node in 1,024 updates / 56 seconds. Both valid
  arms bind the same 200k base/data/seed/8,192 examples/297,217 parameters and exact initial-adapter hash
  `294fd4d40baf74c481fe6575b1df31ae98869373e9fe19a4bfdb4095f6833d09`. Read-only NLL jobs
  `688955 -> 688957` scored 224 held-out cases in six conditions. Locked Stokes comparison reports
  recurrent-over-reset NLL **-0.26736 fit-IID / -0.26769 depth-OOD**, state-necessity margin **0.00377**,
  within-model recurrence margin **0.01446**, and zero exact-sequence regime wins. All advancement gates
  are false. Both adapters and three reports are SHA-verified and mirrored locally; no generation or
  public board is authorized. The causal lesson is that answer-only source-visible supervision learns a
  useful one-step prompt bias, while recurrent updates homogenize information and shuffled states remain
  almost interchangeable.

- **2026-07-14 13:08--13:13** — **The next architecture gate is Causal Microcode Bottleneck, and no
  GPU job exists yet.** VRW's negative result and DRS's 497/500 correct first states versus 275/500
  closed loops motivate replacing repeated textual state serialization with a categorical program and
  compact learned executor. The frozen base is only a causal semantic compiler: layer-19 event/query
  representations predict nine operation and five query opcodes. A deterministic frontend extracts
  numeric literals and line boundaries; an explicitly supervised 400-context decimal transition table
  performs add/sub over two eight-digit registers. This is intentionally neuro-symbolic and its claim
  boundary is narrow. Local unit, syntax, shell, and gradient-freeze tests pass. Review caught and fixed
  two pre-launch risks: the board contains **896**, not 224, rows, and the wrappers now require a
  cryptographically bound CMB admission report. That report independently checks every intermediate
  register for negative values/overflow and requires exact 400/400 local transitions. Full 96,000/896
  CPU admission on Stokes is the next gate; only then may an isolated H100 compiler fit start.

- **2026-07-14 13:13--13:22** — **CMB r1 establishes exact same-language depth composition but fails
  the locked language-transfer gate.** Stokes admission `738772` completed in 4m02s: 96,000 train and
  896 evaluation rows, exact 400/400 local transitions, zero oracle errors, zero negative/overflowing
  registers, and train/eval/tokenizer hashes bound in report SHA-256 `893386103c2484308769e24ab94001d5b6026a38095d038bf8e42ccc6a841fa2`.
  Isolated H100 `688994` then trained only the 225,742-parameter compiler/table on 32,768 examples and
  2,048 updates in 57s; base parameters remained frozen. Read-only `688995` scores fit **251/256** and
  depth-5/6/8 OOD **155/192**, while depth-matched shuffled programs score only 45/896 overall. The
  predicted program is therefore causally used and executes beyond training depth. However, unseen
  language scores only **19/256**, full OOD **1/192**, and exact programs **408/896**. Confusions are
  systematic: held-out gain/take-away/relocate language maps to trained merge/move modes, and unseen
  queries default toward register 1. R1 fails four locked gates and cannot receive a decoder bridge.
  The justified next test changes the compiler supervision, not the executor: paired paraphrases with
  disjoint entity labels and a semantic-equivalence constraint, while preserving every held-out phrase.

- **2026-07-14 13:22--13:30** — **Paired Semantic-Equivalence Compilation r2 is implemented under a
  matched attribution gate; no r2 data or job exists yet.** A deterministic CPU builder maps 48,000
  immutable structured programs into two language views with different entity vocabularies, operation
  wording, query wording, and domains while preserving the exact relative opcode/value/query sequence.
  All 16 domain vocabularies rotate through both views; review fixed an earlier even/odd schedule that
  would have leaked the view through labels. Held-out phrases such as `relocate`, the exact exchange
  wording, and `after all updates` are absent. The trainer right-pads only after causal read positions
  and runs two matched arms from the same initial adapter: diverse paired supervision with weight 0,
  and the same data with symmetric operation/query KL weight 0.2. A locked comparator requires both
  the original absolute CMB gates and >=5pp equivalence-over-control gains on language+full answers and
  exact programs, with <=3pp fit/depth regression. If only the control passes, credit belongs to diverse
  data, not the new loss. CPU generation, pair integrity, public overlap, response-contract, lexical,
  oracle, width, and held-out-language 13-gram admission all precede H100 use.

- **2026-07-14 13:30--13:36** — **The direct interaction board is frozen before r2 training.** Eight
  hand-authored scenarios use new spaceport, aquarium, music-hall, mission-control, greenhouse,
  newsroom, robotics-lab, and film-vault language over 4/5/6/7-event programs. Independent lexical and
  exact-table replay confirms 8/8 oracle answers, zero width failures, maximum register 75, and coverage
  of all nine opcodes. `inspect_categorical_microcode.py` prints question text, predicted and expected
  programs, predicted query, and final answer. Structured fields are used only for scoring and lexical
  positions; the neural compiler sees question text. R1 will be probed immediately, then both r2 arms
  face the byte-identical frozen board. CPU build/admission `738775` is running on Stokes `ec51` and has
  already written the 96,000-row paired corpus SHA-256 `4532e06c32321d8e93c8e2f8bdb15334faaf95d9a756f5361d3af2920834dd05`;
  no r2 H100 job is authorized until all remaining audits pass.

- **2026-07-14 13:36--13:45** — **Paired Semantic-Equivalence Compilation r2 completes and is
  rejected.** Stokes `738775` admitted 96,000 rows / 48,000 exact pairs with zero malformed pairs,
  duplicates, held-out-language 13-grams, oracle errors, or width failures. Matched H100 control
  `689015` and KL=0.2 candidate `689016` used identical base/data/seed/init hash and completed 6,000
  updates in 192s/210s. Control/candidate evaluation is fit 44/256 vs 46/256, depth 4/192 vs 1/192,
  language 44/256 vs 44/256, full 9/192 vs 12/192, and exact programs 30/896 vs 30/896. Combined
  language+full rises only 11.83% -> 12.50%, not the locked five-point gain. Both frozen manual
  interactions are 1/8 and solve the same newsroom case with the same exact program. Comparator
  `738781` records `reject_paired_compiler_r2`; report SHA-256 is
  `d4f4844a573b4a4c37586737111ede80d48a0f431447e5fae0cb457b536b6828`. Output-logit KL is nearly
  redundant with assigning both paraphrases the same labels, and neither arm retained the original
  anchor language. No decoder bridge is authorized.

- **2026-07-14 13:45--14:00** — **Counterfactual Role-Equivariant Compilation r3 is implemented and
  preregistered, with no data or H100 job yet.** R2 improves held-out operation-kind recognition over
  r1 (about 374/640 versus 255/640) but still fails role and query binding. R3 therefore decomposes
  every event into five operation kinds plus a two-way destination role, and every query into three
  query kinds plus a selected-register role. Each of 48,000 programs has the exact r1 anchor, two
  training-only paraphrases, and exact register-permuted versions of all three. The permutation swaps
  initial register values and every structured role while preserving the selected scalar answer; the
  independent audit must prove this automorphism and replay every intermediate state. Both H100 arms
  see the same planned 288,000 rows. The control receives factorized labels only; the candidate adds
  normalized semantic-view feature alignment plus kind-invariant/role-swapped counterfactual losses.
  They must match base/data/admission/seed/order/schedule/init hash. The original absolute CMB gates,
  >=5pp matched attribution gates, and byte-identical eight-case manual board remain binding.

- **2026-07-14 14:00--14:07** — **R3 passes its 64-program CPU smoke; full data remains
  unauthorized until a real Stokes batch runs.** Stokes jobs `738783` on ec59 and `738784` on ec60
  were scheduler-canceled after two seconds before opening a log or writing an artifact; both are
  infrastructure non-results. The lightweight smoke then ran directly on the Stokes login host with
  one BLAS thread: 384 rows, 64 complete six-view groups, zero semantic/permutation mismatches,
  384/384 oracle execution, zero width errors, zero exact or held-out-language 13-gram hits, and all
  response contracts valid. A blanket all-eval full-text scan correctly found 128 intended anchor
  boilerplate hits against same-surface fit/depth slices. It is preserved as a rejected report. The
  replacement regime-aware audit permits exactly those 128 anchor rows and reports zero forbidden
  rows against language/full OOD, the manual board, and all other evaluations. The full 48,000-program
  job must reproduce exactly two allowed anchor rows per program and zero forbidden rows.

- **2026-07-14 14:07--14:20** — **R3 mechanics pass, but its first full artifact is correctly rejected
  before training.** Isolated H100 `689057` completed 16 updates over 64 six-view groups from immutable
  200k with finite classification, semantic, permutation, basis, and gradient-norm telemetry; the base
  stayed frozen and no CMB capability is claimed. Full Stokes build `738788` then produced 288,000 rows
  but independent admission found **988 duplicate normalized questions** and **3 exact fit-IID prompt
  matches**. Automorphism, group integrity, oracle execution, width, and held-out-language checks were
  otherwise clean. The artifact is rejected and must be preserved under its job ID. The builder now
  selects complete six-view groups from the larger immutable source pool, rejecting any group with an
  internal collision, collision with a prior selected group, or exact held-out prompt match; it reports
  source rows scanned, skip reasons, and a hash of selected source indices. No JSONL is edited in place.
  The matched full arms are preregistered at semantic/permutation weights **0/0** for control and
  **0.5/1.0** for candidate, with identical 48,000 groups, seed, order, 12,000 updates, base, and initial
  adapter. Neither H100 arm may start until the rebuilt artifact passes every structural, quality,
  regime-aware full-text, and response-contract gate.

- **2026-07-14 14:20--14:27** — **Pre-fit review removed a redundant treatment before it could waste
  the matched experiment.** The first r3 mechanics code applied the register permutation loss to output
  logits. Opposite supervised role labels already impose nearly the same constraint, repeating the
  central weakness diagnosed in r2. It is superseded before any full fit. The corrected compiler splits
  every operation/query representation into kind and role features. Role logits come from one signed
  scalar as `[s, -s]`; the exact register-swap action therefore flips them. Candidate-only losses align
  kind features under the `Z2` swap and align role features to the negative of their counterfactual,
  while semantic paraphrases align both factors. Supervised labels prevent the zero-feature collapse.
  The control uses the identical factorized architecture and all six views but weights these feature
  constraints 0/0. Comparator metadata now also locks updates, learning rate, warmup, clipping, basis
  weight, signed-role contract, and exact 0.5/1.0 treatment weights. Local tensor, gradient-freeze,
  generator, and comparator contracts pass. The earlier `689057` canary no longer certifies this revised
  architecture; a fresh isolated mechanics canary is mandatory after CPU admission.

- **2026-07-14 14:27--14:34** — **The clean full artifact passes its hard content gates; an inverted
  sanity expectation, not the data, stopped the job.** Stokes `738790` selected 48,000 groups after
  scanning 48,372 immutable sources and skipping 369 prior-group collisions plus 3 exact held-out
  prompts. Its 288,000 rows (SHA-256
  `9f97e9339f665de27d99195d5b4f61c8c09681ea268cd4459a5e212b8875267f`) have zero duplicate
  questions, exact eval prompts, held-out-language 13-grams, malformed groups, semantic/permutation
  mismatches, oracle errors, width violations, or public-eval overlaps. The regime-aware full-text
  audit found 95,972 allowed anchor-boilerplate overlaps and zero forbidden rows, then failed because
  it incorrectly required all 96,000 anchor rows to overlap. Direct inspection found the 28 misses are
  ordinary orchard anchors with no shared 13-gram; absence of overlap is desirable. The corrected gate
  still requires exactly 96,000 rows in each semantic view, zero exact matches, zero forbidden overlap,
  and overlap only from anchors, but treats 96,000 as a maximum rather than a required contamination
  count. The failed report is preserved; the immutable data is not regenerated or edited.

- **2026-07-14 14:34--14:35** — **Full r3 is admitted and the matched causal test is live.** Corrected
  Stokes audit `738794` completed in 35s: 95,972 allowed anchor-only boilerplate rows, zero exact or
  forbidden overlap, exactly 96,000 rows in each semantic view, and an answer-only response contract
  over all 288,000 rows. Structural admission SHA-256 is
  `0de260a4f6e820603fd4a45cacec75b076730fc2b206d6093b46b5f8479db457`; full-text report is
  `dff807b1f02694c37af6a0b10500c290c85f699ad0cbca0243d320d2cff0ff7d`; contracts report is
  `9890f2d7d4a4378d286ff152cc6cf91a5f459eb13500fc7bcd3002cda370d48a`. Fresh signed-feature
  canary `689068` on evc22 completed 16 updates in 6s with frozen base, 354,504 trainable parameters,
  initial adapter SHA-256 `7cd0690d30aa44ae1e739ddd871cccadaa994ddeabf72ea393650882fa9daee9`, finite gnorm 1.138,
  semantic loss 0.0999, and nontrivial permutation loss 1.8672. Matched full jobs are now concurrent:
  control `689070` on evc22 at weights 0/0 and candidate `689071` on evc23 at 0.5/1.0. Each has
  48,000 groups / 288,000 examples / 12,000 updates and writes only its own isolated output. No
  evaluation, bridge, or reasoning claim is authorized until both exit 0 and matched metadata agrees.

- **2026-07-14 14:35--15:02** — **R3 completes cleanly and is rejected, with a sharper mechanism
  diagnosis than R1/R2.** Matched control `689070` and signed-equivariant candidate `689071` both
  completed 12,000 updates from the same frozen 200k base, admitted data, seed, order, schedule, and
  initial adapter. Read-only held-out jobs `689072/689073` and frozen manual jobs `689074/689076`
  completed without infrastructure failure. Control/candidate fit is **256/256 / 251/256**, depth
  **166/192 / 167/192**, language **52/256 / 60/256**, full **20/192 / 19/192**, all answers
  **494/896 / 497/896**, and exact programs **435/896 / 445/896**. The candidate's combined
  language+full gain is only **+1.56pp** and exact-program gain **+1.12pp**, below both locked +5pp
  attribution gates; neither arm passes the absolute language/full gates. Both hand-authored boards
  are **0/8 answers and 0/8 exact programs**. Locked Stokes comparator `738798` records
  `reject_role_equivariant_compiler_r3` with matched metadata and weight contracts. A post-hoc
  diagnostic, not a gate rewrite, shows the treatment really improves language-OOD operation kind
  **69.22% -> 79.69%** and query kind **45.31% -> 66.41%**, but leaves operation role conditional on
  correct kind at chance-like **55.7% -> 55.6%**; merge kind is only **7/119**, and both arms remain
  **0/64** exact at depth 8. This local-factor/whole-program split points to a missing dynamic entity
  binder plus multiplicative sequence error, not a missing stronger equivariance coefficient. Preserve
  R3; do not tune the failed weights or authorize a decoder bridge.

- **2026-07-14 15:02--15:21** — **R4 Binding-First Referential Slot Compilation is implemented and
  fully CPU-admitted; no full H100 fit yet.** The compiler predicts two entity mentions in the
  introductory line and a semantic target mention in each role-bearing event/query using token-level
  attention. At inference `classify_text` receives only token states and formatting-derived
  intro/event/query spans. Structured keys create training-only mention supervision and score attention;
  they are not model inputs. The candidate resolves role by matching the predicted target's raw token
  identity to the two predicted intro slots; exchanging the slots exchanges role logits exactly. The
  equal-parameter control gets the same token encoder, attention supervision, data, and schedule but
  predicts an absolute role bit from the selected mention context. Stokes `738806` audited all **288,000
  train / 896 eval / 8 manual** rows in 320s with zero alignment or structural errors. Admission SHA-256
  is `c9758c191d6dc0754547c14ad554a7479cc5375f25e6259e9eefa409f30847fc`; train/eval/manual SHA-256
  remains `9f97e933...` / `b9106b32...` / `56be3873...`. Locked full-fit attribution requires matched
  metadata and initialization, all original absolute CMB gates, >=5pp candidate gains on language+full
  answers and all exact programs, >=10pp gain in language+full operation role conditioned on correct
  kind, and <=3pp fit/depth regression. A 64-group candidate mechanics canary must be finite before
  either full arm may start.

- **2026-07-14 15:21--15:41** — **R4 passed mechanics and entered its locked matched fit.** Pointer
  canary `689101` completed 16/16 updates on evc30, with finite loss/mention/basis/gnorm telemetry,
  a fully frozen 200k base, and a load-tested 1.2 MiB adapter at SHA-256
  `1867b5b7f3c25c93785e4e924d43ce68a7e6c40d544e1a3348d3d5e85ac029d2`. Its 9m26s allocation
  exposed full-corpus preprocessing as the startup bottleneck; actual training took 22s. A
  backward-compatible single-tokenization correction plus progress telemetry passed categorical,
  referential, comparator, and syntax contracts, was pushed as `430f84e`, and is hash-matched on
  Newton. Full control `689104` (absolute role) and candidate `689105` (pointer role) now run 12,000
  matched updates over the same 48,000 groups / 288,000 rows. Both report 300,493 trainable adapter
  parameters, zero trainable base parameters, and identical initial adapter SHA-256
  `fd1d2b04607b1d0c81c12551ea9d7667b91b9260453e862370e540344619fabb`; early telemetry is finite.
  Held-out `689106/689107` and manual `689108/689109` are dependency-gated. No score or bridge claim
  exists until the full matched comparator closes every preregistered gate.

- **2026-07-14 15:41--15:50** — **An exact future-Jacobian diagnostic is staged while R4 trains.**
  The 2026 global-workspace paper's J-lens averages causal influence on all current/future final
  residuals; prior Shohin logit-lens nulls measured immediate unembedding and cannot close that
  hypothesis. New read-only `jacobian_workspace.py` adapts the exact row-batched estimator to the
  custom 30-layer / 576-width model, freezes all weights, hashes every input, and writes only an
  isolated diagnostic matrix. A tiny-transformer contract proves dim-batch 1/4 equivalence, finite
  matrices, correct transport, and zero parameter gradients. The preregistered one-prompt H100
  canary cannot establish a workspace: stability, future-over-immediate readout, bidirectional
  concept swaps, zero/shuffled controls, and cross-operation reuse are all still required. The
  conditional Sparse Jacobian Recurrent Workspace idea is documented in `REASONING_FRONTIER.md` but
  no fit is authorized before both R4 and causal J-space evidence.

- **2026-07-14 15:50--16:00** — **Future-Jacobian mechanics and cross-prompt stability pass; semantic
  utility remains untested.** Job `689112` was a valid one-layer partial because Slurm truncated a
  comma-separated exported layer list to layer 5; it is preserved, locally hash-verified at SHA-256
  `d6a453cd09c7946c6aff4afdff36039a36c2638ecbbf386762dd25ebce029dcc`, and makes no seven-layer
  claim. Corrected default-layer canary `689114` completed layers 5/9/13/17/21/25/28 in 17s with all
  finite 576x576 matrices; local SHA-256 is
  `c60ae98ebcbf7c835c0ca543491ea1b0c551b9477b626bdc43b548679f1e49b3`. Independent disjoint
  eight-prompt fits `689115/689116` then completed in 38s/35s. Whole-matrix cosine rises from 0.949
  at layer 5 to 0.999 at layer 28; top-16 right-subspace overlap spans 0.866--0.993. This establishes
  a reproducible future-causal transport map, not a workspace. The next frozen 896-case readout gate
  compares future-Jacobian against immediate-logit ranks at identical event/query positions, selects
  only among layers 13/17/21/25, and requires >=1.25x language/full MRR plus >=10pp top-10 gain before
  any separate causal swap.

- **2026-07-14 16:00--16:05** — **The frozen future-Jacobian semantic gate fails; no causal swap or
  Jacobian bridge is authorized.** Read-only job `689118` scored all 896 existing R4 eval cases and
  selected layer 13 under the frozen language+full MRR rule. Future-Jacobian MRR is 0.0002588 versus
  immediate-logit 0.0001535 (1.69x), but both methods recover **0/2,304** language/full targets in the
  top 10 and **0/2,304** in the top 100. The relative ratio is therefore a rank-tail artifact, not a
  useful semantic workspace. `advance_to_causal_swap=false`; report SHA-256 is
  `dd173d677748d4b08113c02c4664c4fcca533f1ab5028c77a25062b28362533e`. Preserve the stable-map result,
  close the raw-Jacobian intervention branch, and let matched R4 dynamic-binding scores determine
  whether the next controlled experiment should explicitly *install* a semantic recurrent state.

- **2026-07-14 16:05--16:24** — **R4 closes as a formal rejection with a large, specific dynamic-
  binding success.** Matched control/pointer fits `689104/689105`, held-out evaluations `689106/689107`,
  and manual boards `689108/689109` all completed cleanly. Pointer raises language OOD 29/256 ->
  139/256, full OOD 2/192 -> 51/192, all exact programs 469/896 -> 624/896, and language+full role
  accuracy conditioned on correct operation kind 57.92% -> 100%. It clears every matched attribution
  gain and preservation gate, but the locked absolute full-OOD floor still fails (26.56% < 40%), and
  manual remains 1/8 answers / 1/8 exact programs. Comparator
  `890a19c1d9eaad04b5d09b5216f2622a01036ba140c11455bc6837bc23a79d54` therefore records
  `reject_referential_slot_compiler_r4`. The error is sharply localized: unseen `take ... away from`
  subtraction is predicted as two-entity move in 116/123 language and 206/243 full subtraction events.

- **2026-07-14 16:24** — **Established a CPU-only exact future-effect algebra and a fresh R5
  hypothesis; no model fit yet.** Every event/program in the current domain is an affine operator over
  two entity registers. New `future_effect_algebra.py` composes that operator exactly, preserves
  chronological chunk composition after source dropping, and reproduces all 896 held-out answers.
  A deliberately post-hoc, label-assisted arity diagnostic changes no fit/depth case but lifts the
  frozen R4 pointer to 213/256 language and about 120/192 full by distinguishing one-argument subtract
  from two-argument move. This cannot rewrite R4. The next valid experiment must construct the argument
  graph from predicted text-only slots and validate on a fresh lexical split frozen after this finding.

- **2026-07-14 16:24--16:46** — **R5's text-only argument graph clears development but is now bound
  to an untouched fresh-board comparator.** Frozen threshold 0.80 uses only projected token identities,
  predicted intro slots, and formatting-derived line spans to infer whether an event mentions one or
  two entities; no structured operation label enters inference. On the old development board it scores
  fit **252/256**, depth **173/192**, language **226/256**, full **146/192**, and exact programs
  **773/896**. Because the rule was derived from R4 errors, those scores have no confirmatory standing.
  Before reading any fresh result, code/tests/docs lock the confirmatory gate: 256 new language and 192
  new full cases; >=70% / >=55% answers; >=15pp answers and >=10pp exact programs over the unchanged
  pointer adapter on the byte-identical board; >=95% inferred arity; all five operation and three query
  kinds; all original absolute gates; and <=10pp fit/depth regression. Stokes CPU job `738850` builds
  that board from new greenhouse/depot/laboratory/library templates and must report zero exact or
  13-gram overlap against both R4 train and development. Separate structural and mention-label
  admissions bind fresh evaluation without changing the adapter's original training admission. No
  H100 evaluation or future-effect operator fit is authorized before those immutable admissions pass.

- **2026-07-14 16:46** — **Added an exact error-correcting future-effect code reference, without
  authorizing a model fit.** Eight fixed state probes crossed with eight future-query probes encode a
  3x3 operator as 64 observable effects. Valid codes occupy a nine-dimensional linear subspace; the
  projection residual is an explicit syndrome. CPU tests recover clean operators, exactly repair one
  arbitrarily corrupted effect scalar, and preserve source-dropped chunk composition after independent
  decode. This is a coding/mechanics contract, not a novelty or reasoning claim. If the fresh R5 parser
  gate passes, the eventual matched control must use the same 64 output channels and a frozen random
  full-rank operator code so any gain tests future-effect geometry rather than redundancy or parameters.

- **2026-07-14 16:43--17:15** — **The untouched R5 board passes admission and decisively rejects
  argument arity as the missing compiler mechanism.** Stokes build/admission `738850/738851` produced
  448 fresh cases over greenhouse/depot/laboratory/library plus 448 pinned controls, with zero exact or
  13-gram train/development overlap, oracle errors, width errors, or mention-span failures. Concurrent
  read-only H100 jobs `689169/689170` used the same pointer adapter on evc42. Raw/graph fresh answers are
  **196/448 / 195/448** and exact programs **174/448 / 172/448**; graph language is 142/256 and full
  53/192, failing every locked confirmatory gain/floor. Arity itself is 96.61%, but only 115/408 raw
  kind errors cross its unary/binary partition. Of 130 changed kinds, 21 are corrected, 23 harmed, and
  86 remain wrong; seven answer failures are fixed while eight correct answers break. The fresh error
  distribution is primarily add->subtract/merge, move->merge/swap, and swap->merge. R5 is closed with
  `reject_argument_graph_r5`; no threshold tuning and no continuation under its failed gate.

- **2026-07-14 17:15** — **R6 is separated from failed R5: Counterfactual Effect-Coded Operators.**
  R4 established dynamic entity binding; R5 shows incidence is recoverable but semantically insufficient.
  R6 therefore predicts what an event does, including its numeric value, across an orthogonal 8x8 bank
  of counterfactual states/future queries. The Hadamard-derived 64x9 code has exact condition number 1,
  a measurable invalid-code syndrome, exact 896-program round trips, one-scalar correction, and exact
  decoded chunk composition in CPU tests. A matched control must use identical slots, parameters, output
  width, data, updates, and a frozen random orthogonal code. R5 fresh is development from this point.
  Before any fit, freeze a new lexical/value/composition split, the control code/hash, probe holdouts,
  source-drop/zero/shuffle/counterfactual gates, and an inference path that does not consume structured
  operation values. No broad reasoning claim can precede transfer through that full chain.

- **2026-07-14 17:15--17:26** — **A pre-fit equivalence proof blocks a cosmetic R6 and replaces it
  with active latent experimentation.** Any two full-rank 64x9 linear codes that decode to the same
  3x3 operator are connected by a fixed transport; operator composition commutes with that transport.
  The proposed structured-code versus random-orthogonal-code comparison would therefore test a basis
  name, not reasoning, and no H100 fit is authorized under that design. New exact CPU mechanics define
  an Active Counterfactual Distinction Loop over 597 lawful event hypotheses (six numeric families at
  values 1--99 plus three structural operators). It selects the state/query probe with maximal
  hypothesis-partition information. Oracle identification resolves every operator in at most three
  probes, mean 1.838, versus deterministic random mean 2.822 and maximum 13. The next neural test must
  use one shared text-conditioned scalar effect head and compare active versus random scheduling on
  that byte-identical model with an equal probe budget. Structured operation values remain forbidden;
  zero/shuffle/oracle, unseen value/language, longer composition, source dropping, intervention, and
  direct interaction gates must be frozen before any confirmatory board or H100 fit.

- **2026-07-14 17:26--17:47** — **R6 selected-probe neural mechanics pass their first isolated H100
  canary.** Commit `1ce95ed` freezes the active distinction cell, probe-conditioned scalar head,
  48-train/16-held-out probe split, preservation losses, and active/random/zero/shuffle/oracle evaluator
  before fresh data. Job `689183` ran on evc33, separate from protected evc34, exhaustively compiled the
  admitted 288,000-row development substrate and completed 16/16 updates over 64 groups in 13 training
  seconds. It reports 466,894 adapter parameters, zero trainable base parameters, finite initial effect
  loss 0.0526, inherited kind/role accuracy 1.0, and finite pre-clip gnorm 9.881 under the locked 1.0
  clip. Adapter SHA-256 is `b27805f489cd39069c5d3b919d113d38d2441b27f63ac70ba4d4c0187724a929`,
  hash-matched Newton/local and CPU-load-validated with no base tensors and all finite values. This is
  mechanics evidence only. A longer development fit may proceed on the old substrate to verify effect
  learning and gradient settling; no new confirmatory board may be generated until that architecture,
  schedule, policy tolerance, and latent-step budget remain frozen.

- **2026-07-14 17:47--17:53** — **The frozen R6 full development fit starts cleanly; it has no
  confirmatory standing.** Job `689190` runs on isolated evc25 over the old admitted 48,000-group /
  288,000-row substrate for 12,000 updates. It excludes protected evc34 and writes only
  `train/future_effect_r6_200k_dev1`. Through step 450, normalized effect loss has reached 0.0035--0.0234
  on recent logged batches after starting at 0.0526, while finite pre-clip gradient norm settles from
  9.881 to a recent 0.359--0.534 band; inherited operation kind and
  role remain 1.0 on logged development batches. Continue only while preservation remains intact and
  effect/gnorm telemetry stays finite. After exit 0, the old R5 board is development for the locked
  active/random/zero/shuffled/oracle evaluator. Do not generate the untouched R6 board until those
  scores establish a viable head and the architecture/scheduler stay unchanged.

- **2026-07-14 18:02** — **The frozen R6 development evaluator is dependency-held, not allowed to
  inspect a partial fit.** Job `689196` has `afterok:689190`, one isolated H100, and the immutable
  three-probe active/random/zero/shuffled/oracle policies. It is hash/admission-bound to the unchanged
  200k base, the completed `future_effect_r6_200k_dev1` adapter, the admitted 896-row R5 board
  (448 fresh plus 448 pinned controls),
  the original training-label admission, and that board's separate evaluation-label admission. The
  active and random arms call the byte-identical scalar effect head exactly three times per operation;
  zero/shuffled are causal controls and oracle is only an upper bound. The output is development-only
  `artifacts/eval_history/future_effect_r6_200k_dev1.json`; no R6 confirmatory generator or board exists.

- **2026-07-14 18:02--18:10** — **A conditional R6 context mechanism now has an exact CPU contract,
  without authorizing neural context claims.** `counterfactual_context_folding.py` permits source
  deletion only after selected counterfactual observations leave one lawful operator and an unused
  independent probe validates it. All 597 oracle event certificates pass with at most three selected
  probes plus validation; empty evidence and a corrupted validation effect are rejected. A 4,096-event
  chronological sequence folds exactly into one nine-scalar 3x3 state, retains direct-execution answers,
  and matches associative merging of independently folded chunks. This is an oracle algebra upper bound.
  Neural advancement requires calibrated held-out-probe certificates after active beats random; any later
  context claim also requires beyond-window source-drop transfer, corruption-triggered retention/reopening,
  equal-model raw-context controls, and measured retained-state/prefill/accuracy curves.

- **2026-07-14 18:10--18:18** — **The R6 development advancement rule is frozen in executable code
  before evaluator `689196` can reveal a score.** `evaluate_future_effect_r6.py` correctly treats the
  board as 448 fresh language/full cases plus 448 pinned fit/depth controls. Fresh advancement requires
  >=55% answers, >=50% exact programs, >=65% operations, >=60% language, >=40% full, +10pp over raw R5,
  +5pp answer/exact/operations over equal-call random, and +10pp answer/exact over the better
  zero/shuffled control. It separately requires >=80% fit, >=60% depth, >=80% oracle answer/exact,
  >=95% query accuracy, and finite held-out MSE <= max(2x train MSE, 1.0). Unit fixtures prove a nominal
  pass, equal-active/random rejection, and held-out-calibration rejection. A pass authorizes only one
  untouched board; any failed conjunct closes this head before confirmatory generation.

- **2026-07-14 18:18--18:27** — **Pre-score board/schema audits preserve the intended R6 gate.** The
  admitted file has 896 rows named `fit_iid`, `depth_ood`, `language_ood`, and `full_ood`; the gate and
  qualitative trace reader now enforce those exact names rather than shorthand. A label-only mechanics
  audit using true effects and the evaluator's actual three-step top-64 scheduler establishes its fresh
  ceiling at **382/448 answers (85.27%)** and **365/448 exact programs (81.47%)**. Thus the frozen 80%
  oracle floors are attainable but nontrivial. This audit does not inspect learned adapter outputs and
  does not change the active/random budgets or capability thresholds.

- **2026-07-14 18:22--18:25** — **A noise-calibrated R6b scheduler is preregistered without changing
  R6a.** The hard top-64 runtime has a measurable tie/noise failure mode. New CPU-only
  `future_posterior_distinction.py` keeps a Gaussian score posterior over all 597 hypotheses and chooses
  the maximum weighted-partition-entropy probe. Assumed noise is frozen at 1.0, effect-bin width at 2.0,
  and latent budget at three. Deterministic mechanics recover 100% under exact effects and **92.46%** at
  noise 0.5 versus **88.27%** for hard top-64 under equal noise draws. R6a `689190 -> 689196` must finish,
  score, and retain its original decision first. R6b is eligible only as a separate read-only old-board
  scheduler comparison on the byte-identical adapter with equal calls and unchanged controls; it cannot
  retroactively rescue R6a or authorize fresh data without its own frozen comparator.

- **2026-07-14 18:25--18:27** — **A bounded prior-art check narrows, rather than inflates, the novelty
  claim.** Adjacent primary work exists for uncertainty-aware KV/hidden compression (UNComp),
  compiler-output search compression (Compile to Compress), proof-carrying numeric rendering, and
  natural-language Selection-Inference loops. None of those ingredients is claimed as new. The bounded
  search found no direct match for the full learned scalar counterfactual-effect interface -> posterior
  hypothesis distinction -> independent unused-probe certificate -> associative source-dropped operator
  fold. This is an inference from a bounded search, never proof of world-first status; empirical causal
  gates remain mandatory.

- **2026-07-14 18:36** — **R6 development fit midpoint remains healthy and attributable.** Job
  `689190` reached step 6,700/12,000. Across the latest 2,000-step logged window, normalized effect loss
  averages **0.00180** with maximum 0.0090; finite pre-clip gradient norm averages **0.216** with one
  isolated 1.082 point that recovered on the next log; operation-kind and role accuracy remain 1.0 at
  every logged point. No schedule, data, model, probe split, output, or dependent evaluator changed.

- **2026-07-14 19:14--19:28** — **R6 development fit completes cleanly; evaluation remains unscored
  behind an infrastructure gate.** `689190` completed all **12,000/12,000** updates in 4,997 training
  seconds and Slurm records `COMPLETED`, exit `0`. Its isolated adapter is 1,878,643 bytes, SHA-256
  **`22f88b6af36e07afe4fbe1f87de13bbbbad61f7234d4df1570da82d78b539f69`**, hash-matched Newton/local,
  and CPU-load validated as exactly **466,894** finite adapter parameters in 27 tensors, no `model.*`
  base tensors, protocol `active_counterfactual_distinction_r6`, 12,000 updates, immutable 200k-base
  hash, and frozen pointer-adapter hash. Dependency evaluator `689196` on evc22 and retry `689220` on
  evc25 each exited `124` after 91 seconds with empty reports: instrumentation on idle evc46 proved the
  old guard was killing a still-progressing Lustre-backed `import torch`, before CUDA discovery or any
  R6 inference. No report exists and neither attempt has statistical standing. The generic smoke and
  R6 evaluator now retain a real CUDA tensor test but allow up to five minutes for cold framework import.
  Instrumented smoke `689224` runs on idle evc46; byte-identical frozen evaluator `689225` is pinned to
  the same node with `afterok:689224`. All six local R6 gate/scheduler/folding/trace mechanics scripts
  pass. Do not inspect or generate a confirmatory board until `689225` exits 0 and the preregistered
  executable decision and qualitative transcript readers consume its one fresh development report.

- **2026-07-14 19:31--19:40** — **R6a is formally rejected before a fresh board, while preserving one
  real causal signal.** Instrumented smoke `689224` completed on idle evc46 after a 2m52s cold import,
  then proved CUDA discovery, BF16 allocation, matmul, synchronization, and finite output. Frozen
  evaluator `689225` completed all 896 cases / five equal-three-call policies in 7m32s with exit 0.
  Report SHA-256 is **`cf2c03eeb351044635c700499e186bbcfa53c5156401116f1ceb45e71d2fee4b`**;
  executable decision SHA-256 is **`ad7fa1667d693d3a32f7df0dd05792805869211b38c78159b54994346a8f99de`**;

  **`8f793c9d9e526d75ddd43769cdac795519f9833f382a0d5145d943fea6a73394`**. On the 448 development-fresh
  language/full cases, active scores **36 answers / 19 exact programs / 610 of 1,856 exact operations**;
  random is **25 / 11 / 407**, zero is **14 / 1 / 24**, and shuffled is **11 / 3 / 78**. Thus selected
  counterfactual experiments are physically useful: active beats equal-call random by **+10.94pp**
  operation accuracy and both causal controls by much more. But answer/exact gains over random are only
  **+2.46pp / +1.79pp**, below every advancement gate. Active fit is 165/256 answers and depth 51/192;
  language is 33/256 and full 3/192. Query parsing itself falls to **342/448 = 76.34%** fresh. Oracle
  effects reach 1,733/1,856 operations but only 271/448 answers and 252/448 exact programs because the
  predicted query and three-step truncation still cap the whole program. Learned fresh effect MSE is
  about **130.74** on both train-probe and heldout-probe partitions versus 0.33 fit and 0.84 depth.
  Post-score diagnosis decomposes active fresh operations into **610 exact**, **362 same-opcode/wrong-value**
  (mean absolute value error 5.09; only 35.36% within one), and **884 wrong-opcode**. Subtraction has only
  one exact event across both roles, while structural swap/merge transfers relatively well. Twelve
  verbatim traces confirm both genuine active-only recoveries and catastrophic off-scale semantic
  predictions. Decision is `reject_r6_before_fresh_board`; no fresh R6 board may be generated. R6b's
  preregistered posterior scheduler remains valid mechanics but is not run as a rescue: better experiment
  selection cannot repair the observed unseen-language effect and query representation collapse. The next
  mechanism must identify semantics by a different causal observable, not tune R6 thresholds or probes.

- **2026-07-14 19:40--19:53** — **R7 is preregistered as a genuinely different causal observable,
  not a rescue fit.** Interventional Semantic Quotient compares an unknown natural-language event to
  lawful canonical operators by their nonlinear finite-difference response fields in the immutable
  raw-200k model. Matched visible interventions alter initial values, event values, or entity roles;
  the evaluator records final future-token hidden changes at frozen layers **5, 11, 17, 23, 29**.
  Active selection gets exactly **two** intervention channels, as do deterministic random and shuffled
  controls; unintervened direct hidden similarity is a no-intervention baseline. The canary is frozen at
  exactly **108** already-used development events, **12 per each of nine opcodes**, from language/full
  regimes. Local tests pass, all candidate interventions preserve token width within each finite
  difference, maximum prompt length is 216, and a numeral-binding audit covers all 108 events. The
  executable pre-score gate requires active opcode accuracy >=45%, >=5 points over both random and
  direct similarity, >=15 points over shuffled signatures, and >=4/12 on at least seven opcodes. A pass
  authorizes only a full already-used R5-board evaluation; it cannot authorize training, fresh data,
  source deletion, reasoning, or context-scaling claims. A failure closes the R7 observable. The
  evaluator uses visible identifier strings and numeric literals supplied by the board to construct
  lexical hypotheses, so even a pass is a semantic-identification canary, not a full text-only system.

- **2026-07-14 19:54--19:58** — **R7 completes cleanly and is formally rejected; R8 is frozen from the
  resulting diagnosis.** Read-only H100 job `689233` on evc46 passed CUDA preflight and scored all 108
  events in 23 seconds, Slurm exit 0. Report SHA-256 is
  **`2531c6f5b0166feab75a02ac4061fb96e1f773e072c4a690a72436d8a106cfbd`** and executable decision

  random **30/108**, direct **46/108**, and shuffled **24/108**; active reaches the opcode floor in only
  four of nine families. All five frozen gates fail, so no full or fresh R7 board is authorized. Direct
  hidden similarity is 24/72 numeric and 22/36 structural, whereas active first-order intervention is
  13/72 numeric and 19/36 structural. R7 therefore finds that generic first-order perturbation directions
  retain role structure but obscure arithmetic operator identity. R8 is preregistered before its code or
  score as **Counterfactual Curvature Binding**: compare the mixed response
  `h(i,j) - h(i) - h(j) + h(0)` for unknown text and canonical operators. The fixed pairs are event
  value x each initial role for numeric events and event roles x each initial role for structural events;
  equal-count random-pair, shuffled-curvature, direct, R7-active, numeric/structural, and per-opcode gates
  are frozen in `REASONING_FRONTIER.md`. This is a used-board read-only mechanism test only.

- **2026-07-14 19:59--20:07** — **R8 completes cleanly and rejects local hidden curvature as the
  missing program interface.** The complete 108-case joint-intervention audit passed before scoring:
  exact 12-per-opcode balance, all base/single/joint variants token-width matched, and maximum 216 tokens.
  Code, controls, and gates were committed as `f7acc04` before H100 job `689237` ran on evc46. The job
  completed all cases in 22 seconds with Slurm exit 0. Report SHA-256 is

  **26/108**, random-pair **28/108**, shuffled-curvature **24/108**, and direct remains **46/108**.
  Numeric curvature is **12/72**, structural **14/36**, and only two opcode families reach 5/12. All
  eight gates fail; decision is `reject_r8_curvature_canary`, and no confirmation board exists. Median
  unknown-event curvature norm is 87.15, so the signal is present but semantically unaligned rather than
  numerically zero. Do not search layers, pairs, or score normalizations post hoc. The documented next
  direction is Orbit-Consistent Recurrent Microcode: direct semantics initialize a weight-tied latent
  operator/state cell, causal orbit laws train its transitions, and an independent unused-counterfactual
  syndrome gates commitment and adaptive replay. It must first pass a CPU equivalence audit proving it is
  not ordinary label augmentation or confidence thresholding; no H100 R9 fit is authorized yet.

  cross-entropy differs from ordinary transformed-label augmentation by exactly **0.0**. Its static
  Jensen-Shannon syndrome is computed entirely from the unchanged view logits. All equivalence gates
  pass, so decision is `reject_static_orbit_recurrence_as_reparameterized_classifier` and
  `authorize_neural_fit=false`. Report SHA-256 is
  **`2985a56636bd288b1a1b3ea88fa80fec4f2da0e64298c7754b92637029a70bfa`**. Replaying fixed evidence
  is not reasoning, regardless of whether the loop is weight-tied or given an adaptive stop label.

- **2026-07-14 20:12--20:18** — **R9b replaces fixed consensus with a bidirectional,
  noncommutative, fail-closed execution contract; exact CPU mechanics pass, neural semantics remain
  unproven.** `train/bidirectional_operator_tree.py` requires independent forward state-conditioned
  and backward goal-conditioned operator hypotheses at every event. A leaf is source-droppable only
  when both full affine effects agree; internal chronological products remain certified only if both
  children were already certified, so opposite leaf errors cannot cancel at a parent. Across all
  **896/896** frozen programs the oracle tree certifies and answers exactly. The same event multiset in
  two orders yields different answers (**7** and **10**). A clean **4,096-event** history collapses to
  one nine-scalar operator and zero source strings. Corrupting only the backward hypothesis at event
  **2,345** retains exactly that source plus 12 certified sibling summaries: **13** frontier nodes and
  **109** numeric scalars. Equal 99.9% confidence cannot reproduce the directional syndrome. Report
  SHA-256 is **`d9f303168d78363a780b94e203bb2435e3b1b3086d46b2c31e67d3da419a1350`**. The explicit limitation
  is equally important: two channels that agree on the same wrong operator are falsely certified.
  Therefore this result authorizes only neural-design preregistration. Before an H100 canary, freeze
  genuinely different evidence paths, a same-parameter single compiler, two heads without syndrome,
  shuffled backward goals, fixed-step versus syndrome-adaptive replay, and an agreed-wrong stress set.
  Do not describe exact oracle execution or source folding as learned reasoning.

- **2026-07-14 20:18--20:23** — **A bounded prior-art check narrows R9b to a plausible combination
  novelty, not a world-first claim.** Existing work separately covers neural-guided bidirectional
  program search, iterative forward-backward abstract interpretation, execute-and-repair neural
  synthesis, fixed-point recurrent halting, and commitment-preserving context compression. The search
  did not locate the exact combination of independently state/goal-conditioned per-event compilers,
  fail-closed certification inherited through a noncommutative product tree, and syndrome-localized
  reopening of only failed source leaves. `REASONING_FRONTIER.md` records the closest primary sources
  and the claim boundary. Positive matched neural evidence and a broader systematic review are required
  before any publication-level novelty statement.

- **2026-07-14 20:23--20:36** — **R9c turns the oracle contract into a dynamic trainable tensor
  mechanism and clears the pre-language causal audit.** `train/bidirectional_syndrome_microcode.py`
  implements independent recurrent compilers. Forward event evidence is conditioned only on the
  incoming carried state; backward event evidence is conditioned only on the future query covector
  pulled through the suffix. Their only recurrent cross-channel message is the signed difference of
  the complete 3x3 affine effects. In the deterministic CPU audit, the gradient of the last forward
  decision with respect to the first event is **5.2913e-05** while its parameter-identical static
  control is exactly **0.0**; the reverse-direction gradient is **3.7578e-04** versus static **0.0**.
  Perturbing the backward compiler changes second-round forward logits by **0.0767836** with syndrome
  and exactly **0.0** without syndrome. An adaptive high-threshold run spends **15/0/0** event updates
  over three rounds versus fixed **15/15/15**. All nine mechanics gates pass. Report SHA-256 is
  **`aa61b2ca539c7aaf7d4dd23bdce3c65ab63d3b270e3dae9b4cea45ed43c52536`** and explicitly keeps
  `authorize_language_fit=false` until the bridge and controls are frozen.

- **2026-07-14 20:23--20:36** — **The text bridge, disjoint supervision, four matched arms, and
  used-board decision are now frozen before any H100 score.** The immutable raw-200k checkpoint and
  admitted R4 pointer adapter produce a **521-dimensional** per-event feature from text-derived kind
  context, target context, old kind evidence, pointer-role evidence, and slot-presence evidence. The
  old static opcode decision is not reused. The frozen text query head produces a soft query covector;
  structured keys/opcodes remain absent at inference. Forward training observes only next-state effects
  on actual prefixes, backward training only future-goal pullbacks, plus agreement and endpoint losses;
  there is **no opcode cross-entropy**. The production memory width 96 adds **328,502** trainable
  parameters to the frozen base/pointer substrate. `treatment`, `static`, `no_syndrome`, and
  `shuffled_goal` arms have identical initialization, data, updates, and parameter count. A full local
  integration through the actual checkpoint/tokenizer/pointer/held-out row passes. The used-board gate
  requires treatment operation margins of +3pp over static, +2pp over no-syndrome, and +5pp over
  shuffled goals; +3pp answer margin over static; language/full answer floors 60%/35%; 95% fit/depth
  operation preservation; <=50% common-mode share of wrong operations; adaptive replay within -1pp
  operation accuracy while spending <=80% of fixed updates; and >=98% query accuracy. Passing can
  authorize only a full matched fit and one untouched confirmation board, never a reasoning claim by
  itself.

- **2026-07-14 20:45--21:03** — **R9c completes its matched neural test and is formally rejected.**
  The first attempts `689252--689255` exited before model code because a redundant torch preflight and
  unbounded OpenBLAS threads hit the cluster process limit; `e1f7964` removes the duplicate preflight
  and `f400e25` pins BLAS/OMP threads. Corrected fits `689259--689262` then completed cleanly on four
  isolated H100s. Every arm is contract-identical: initial adapter SHA-256
  `712abd97d22a9a284cf0dbfbf7437cbe2d7bc0c292bdead621f442d7e9b3a9eb`, 328,502 parameters,
  4,092 selected groups / 24,552 examples / 1,023 updates, seed 20260714, and identical base, pointer,
  tokenizer, and data hashes. All arms reach perfect in-batch operator decisions, so fit loss is not
  evidence. Dependency-held evaluations `689266--689273` and CPU assessor `689274` produce the frozen
  decision `reject_r9c_used_board_canary` with no contract errors. On the fresh OOD board, treatment
  operation/answer accuracy is **78.29% / 47.77%**, below static **80.12% / 51.12%**, no-syndrome
  **81.14% / 51.79%**, and shuffled-goal **79.58% / 50.89%**. Treatment full-OOD answers are 30.21%,
  and agreed-wrong operations are 88.83% of all wrong operations. Adaptive replay is mechanically
  useful (1.62 versus 3.0 mean event updates with no treatment accuracy loss), but it efficiently
  replays an inferior shared classifier. The causal diagnosis is that the R4 text bridge exposes enough
  local event evidence for every arm to learn the same static mapping; syndrome exchange neither breaks
  common-mode bias nor extracts useful future-goal semantics. No threshold tuning, full fit, reasoning
  claim, or context-scaling claim is allowed. Canonical decision SHA-256 is
  `cb3013800daaeb95b0bc8b2d454b89cf177a4e2dc652633eb0392a625a87b012`; all eight reports and four
  adapters are hash-mirrored locally and retained on Newton.

- **2026-07-14 21:03--21:12** — **Independent ultra-effort review finds a fatal certificate alias and
  narrows the neural result's attribution.** The categorical operator simplex has dimension eight,
  but its expected 3x3 affine-operator projection has linear rank six and affine rank five at values
  1, 3, and 99. Two strictly positive distributions with different executed argmaxes (`add_0` versus
  `move_1_0`) therefore produce the same exact expected operator to **1.11e-16**; after R9c's runtime
  float32 probability cast, their syndrome norm is still only **2.21e-08**, far below the frozen 0.05
  halting threshold. Matrix-syndrome zero can never be a fail-closed certificate for categorical
  execution. The review also proves the training `roll(1)` is not a semantic-goal derangement: examples
  are laid out as six adjacent equivalent views, so **5/6** receive a goal from the same equivalence
  group. Other assessor hardening gaps include missing cross-board adapter-hash enforcement, no selected-
  batch manifest hash, and nominal rather than active parameter matching. These issues cannot rescue the
  result because treatment already loses to the valid static and no-syndrome ablations; they do block
  any stronger future-goal or fail-closed-certificate interpretation. Exact audit
  `train/audit_bidirectional_syndrome_identifiability.py` is regression-tested; local/Newton report
  SHA-256 is **`9c54c1cf498804056aa34b5b5b1d7b78a4c181a69c8b9b7a77904cfb816f1777`**.

- **2026-07-14 21:12--21:19** — **Ultra mode starts R10 with the score and decision gates frozen
  before probability extraction.** Plain version-space composition is retained only as an exact
  diagnostic reference because version-space algebra, candidate-set calibration, and active program
  disambiguation have clear prior art. The actual hypothesis is Annihilator-Certified Ambiguity
  Workspace (ACAW): carry a sound affine hull of every still-lawful 3x3 transform, certify the current
  answer only when its query annihilates every ambiguity direction, and delete reusable source only
  under rank-zero or a declared-reader-family proof. Nonzero ambiguity retains witness provenance for
  localized replay. The frozen neural score provider is the R9c no-syndrome adapter SHA-256
  `bf07d65075a42142c34bfc510cbef95290a9b8a0f7ed96ac1d4abc5f175a6480`; the used board SHA-256 is
  `d85f16ff374b0c650cf3603826cc5f3b377842818db62bada3b84e71308b9473`. One global 97% split-conformal
  threshold is calibrated on fit/depth only; language/full are evaluation only. Exact-set cap 32,
  overflow fail-closed, zero false certificates/drops, >=99% selective answer accuracy at >=40%
  coverage, and explicit query-intervention/replay gates are preregistered in `REASONING_FRONTIER.md`.
  A used-board pass can authorize only one untouched 4/8/16/32 board; failure closes the score-provider
  path without threshold or cap tuning.

- **2026-07-14 21:19--21:32** — **Adversarial proof review hardens R10 before any neural score is
  extracted.** The affine product formula is sound, but three initial claim boundaries were too loose.
  First, 97% event-marginal coverage compounds across a long program, so the single frozen conformal
  score is now the program maximum over every true operation **and** the true query. Second, current-
  query annihilation can become observable after a future continuation, so reader-family deletion is
  removed. Rank zero now permits only candidate-conditional hot-context eviction with an immutable
  retrieval pointer; irreversible deletion remains zero. Third, bilinear cross-terms can make two
  leaves jointly observable, so basis-magnitude witness selection is forbidden. Refinement must be a
  monotone candidate-set reduction followed by exact path-to-root recomputation, and it may resolve an
  abstention or uncertified top-1 error but never "correct" a sound certificate. Homogeneous affine
  ambiguity also has rank at most six, not nine. Event/query coverage, complete-program coverage, false
  hot evictions, and retrieval-backed hot-source removal are now distinct frozen metrics. The score
  tensor still does not exist; these changes remain genuinely preregistered.

- **2026-07-14 21:32--21:50** — **The exact replay reference removes its own hidden linear witness
  before untouched-board scoring.** The first VSPT implementation concatenated a canonical opcode
  path inside every complete transform. Although compact serialization omitted that field, the live
  Python root still carried a 4,096-step witness and duplicated source tuples through its ancestors;
  that was logical rather than physical compaction. The corrected tree SHA-256-commits every leaf
  atom, every alias support, and every supporting child pair while retaining the exact factorized
  child topology as replay authority. Raw source references now exist only at leaves. A compact
  singleton stores one exact transform, fixed-size support/node commitments, and a contiguous range
  retrieval pointer, never a linear opcode list. The established affine-operator/query parity test,
  noncommutative exhaustive mechanics, alternate-derivation refinement, overflow reconstruction,
  and 4,096-event history all pass. This strengthens the context implementation without overstating
  it: unresolved factorized provenance and external source remain linear in the worst case, and no
  neural reasoning score has yet been read.

- **2026-07-14 21:50--22:03** — **R10 mechanics are implemented and pushed before any probability
  extraction; the live 252.5k recovery point is also protected.** Commit `a8af84b` adds the exact
  noncommutative VSPT, ACAW exact-rational hull/certificate mechanics, and a provenance-bound probability
  extractor. Canonical accounting separately measures active hot state, factorized provenance, external
  source payloads, retrieval references, and exact-integer growth; 4,096-event/8,191-node mechanics pass.
  Newton `ckpt_0252500.pt` was promoted to `best_step252500.pt` and downloaded locally; all copies match
  md5 `1769bb0a8a06d4565df001f0521db99e`. No R10 score tensor was read.

- **2026-07-14 22:03--22:18** — **Direct behavior remains negative, R10's first statistical contract is
  rejected before score, and an internal R11 mechanism is preregistered.** Raw 200k and raw 252.5k are both
  1/7 initial, 0/7 review, and 1/7 supplied-fact on the same seven fresh prompts. The apparent 252.5k reuse
  1/7 is a scorer false positive caused by a repeated premise inside malformed state text; valid compact
  reuse remains 0/7. Independent pre-score review found the first R10 boards/evaluator could erase required
  OOD partitions, pass weaker accuracy gates, and support too few accepted cases. Scoring stays blocked while
  an 800 calibration / 1,840 confirmation factorial v2 contract and stricter evaluator are built. Separately,
  `R11_INTERNAL_WORKSPACE_PREREG.md` freezes a 1.61M-parameter internal source-write/recurrent-state/read
  experiment with causal donor transplants, held-out consumer reuse, and strict matched controls. It is a
  design only and cannot touch the flagship.

- **2026-07-14 22:18--22:32** — **R11's first broad evidence contract is rejected before code and
  narrowed to a causal-mediator canary.** Architecture review confirms a six-slot 96-wide writer/cell/reader
  wrapper can fit the current 30-layer model, but corrects the tied base count to 125,081,664 because the
  earlier draft omitted 3,840 learned QK-norm scales. Adversarial review finds the shared donor query could
  collapse into the donor world's ordinary clean task, while answer-position readers could act as a late
  motor corrector. R11a therefore uses crossed 2x2 affine queries whose coefficients appear only after the
  source workspace is cached, a separate equal-answer collision query, source-free readout, readers active
  only during query prefill, and a requirement that early/middle readers retain performance with block 24
  removed. Query/answer invariance, zero query-to-workspace gradient, exact next-token target shifting,
  no-zloss CE, per-arm compute ledgers, and whole-pair bootstrap gates are mandatory CPU contracts. No R11
  code or GPU job is authorized yet.

- **2026-07-14 22:32--23:39** — **R10's replacement evaluator is hardened without opening a score,
  and raw-checkpoint interaction remains negative.** The first v2 draft was independently rejected because
  extraction could begin before complete admission/code closure, confirmation partitions could collapse
  operation families, finite-board results were wrapped in invalid population-confidence language, and some
  cells could pass with too few accepted cases. The replacement validates the frozen gate, independent
  admission, complete train-Python/runtime/Git identity, and all artifact hashes before CUDA, checkpoint load,
  or probability access. It uses exact 800/1,840 board geometry, family/query/depth cells, at least ten accepted
  rows per exact cell and 400 per confirmation partition, zero false certificates, and family-exact empirical
  decisions. Local verification passes 14 generator/auditor tests, five extractor tests, 17 evaluator tests,
  canonical-store accounting, strict transcript scoring, bytecode compilation, Ruff, and shell syntax. No
  probability tensor has been read; the exact committed tree must still be frozen score-blind on Stokes.
  Separately, verified local-MPS interaction shows raw 200k and raw 252.5k both at 1/7 initial, 0/7 review,
  1/7 supplied-fact, and 0/7 valid compact-state reuse. More pretraining has not yet demonstrated broad reasoning.

- **2026-07-14 22:32--23:39** — **R11a v1 is rejected and a narrower v2 is frozen for final contract
  audit only.** V1 left the data/target generator underdefined, risked coefficient/answer leakage, referenced a
  nonexistent source-visible path, duplicated q0 reads, lacked a valid sham-interchange definition, left hidden
  source/KV-cache bypasses and ledgers ambiguous, exposed no sealed confirmation process, and overclaimed what
  reader lesions could localize. V2 SHA-256 is
  `11ca769036b2bc85eebd47a950e51b2bc87158668e47ba3cc5e38e4fdae68408`. It specifies a deterministic
  counter-PRF board, coefficients fixed before worlds, syntax-defined q0 collision, source-only 576-scalar W,
  fresh-cache source-free reads, crossed qA/qB whole-W swaps, query-prefill-only readers, exact call ledgers,
  source-scratch clear/swap/poison/interleaving tests, whole-pair intervals, and a committed one-time confirmation
  seed. Its claim explicitly allows blocks 12/18 to compute query-conditioned answer state after reading W and
  is limited to mediation on one fixed artifact. No implementation, data, fit, score, or H100 job exists; final
  independent audit and CPU/tiny mechanics are mandatory before any execution.

- **2026-07-14 23:39--23:50** — **Independent custody review rejects the locally passing R10 evidence
  chain before any score.** Seven attack surfaces survive the mechanics tests: manifests can self-attest
  without consumers replaying the build binding; clean committed code is enforced only in the optional batch
  wrapper; caller-selectable generator seeds and R5 novelty input permit board shopping; score JSON can be
  altered and rehashed before CPU evaluation; hash-then-reopen paths permit TOCTOU; batch/device/determinism
  identity is incomplete; and source can change between initial and final admission identities. These defects
  invalidate evidentiary custody even if the math and probabilities are honest. No Stokes build or score was
  run. Pipeline custody, the score-to-decision chain, and adversarial tests are now separate hardening workstreams.

- **2026-07-14 23:39--23:50** — **Final contract audit rejects R11a v2 before implementation.** V2
  improved the causal boundary but still regenerated accepted source worlds using affine-answer distinctness,
  token-length, and frequency checks, allowing source distributions to encode supposedly late-bound query
  information. Its declared API returned logits without the query-only decode session required by free
  generation; sham/control evaluation did not state whether primary metrics used native or common crossed rows;
  and a seed commitment could prove fixation but not secrecy. V3 must freeze source worlds before coefficients,
  redraw only coefficients, define teacher/prefill/decode APIs exactly, evaluate all arms on one crossed matrix,
  and replace secret-custody wording with a deterministic post-calibration derivation. V2 SHA-256 remains
  `11ca769036b2bc85eebd47a950e51b2bc87158668e47ba3cc5e38e4fdae68408`; no code or GPU work exists.

- **2026-07-15 00:00--00:31** — **Reasoning research moves from architecture-first iteration to a
  mathematical invention charter.** Four independent theory/mechanism attacks rejected path-ordered products,
  persistent product trees, and Schur boundary actions as new primitives because they collapse to recurrence,
  fast weights, known dynamic data structures, or differentiable algebra. They also established the finite-
  circuit boundary: every fixed-context, finite-precision, bounded classical mechanism can be unrolled, so
  absolute non-equivalence to static computation is impossible. `R12_REASONING_INVENTION_CHARTER.md` now makes
  uniform late-query causal composition the operational target and counterfactual residual derivatives the
  required abstract object. It freezes closure, composition, observation, extensionality, separation, and
  uniformity axioms; an information lower bound; a permutation/parity witness; and mandatory theorem,
  equivalence, exact-collapse, prior-art, CPU-falsifier, matched-control, and score-blind gates. R10 and R11 are
  dormant controls. No R12 code or GPU work is authorized. The protected flagship remained healthy through
  step 257,680 at ~285.21k tok/s; latest rolling checkpoint was 257,500 and 260k remains the next DR target.

- **2026-07-15 00:31--01:12** — **A pure mathematical worker closes FCQ as an ontology and leaves a
  sharper falsifier instead of another renamed module.** Exact realization, extensionality, and deterministic
  update imply a bijection with counterfactual residual behaviors, so every exact reachable candidate is the
  minimal Moore transducer and its event maps form a transition monoid. The charter now records this no-go and
  includes inadmissibility in observable behavior so causal equivalence remains right-congruent. The approximate
  Fork-Core Quotient also collapses: its shared center/update is an approximate information state or PSR; its
  global `D+1` witness is Helly geometry; and its pairwise-to-global radius factor `2D/(D+1)` is the classical
  Jung/Bohnenblust constant. The smallest three-history/three-answer obstruction remains valuable because it
  proves pairwise contrastive merging can pass every edge while lacking one valid shared state. Primary-source
  review also found a June 2026 bounded-memory paper already applying higher-order compatibility and a Helly
  certificate, so no FCQ or Helly novelty claim is admissible. `R12_FORK_CORE_THEORY.md` freezes the definitions,
  proofs, bit/horizon law, prior-art boundary, and no-implementation verdict. A new pure-math worker is attacking
  the unresolved coherent-action-extension problem: extend the whole event action into a compact ambiguity
  space while preserving monoid relations, rather than extending generators independently. The protected
  flagship remained healthy through step 258,910 at ~284.49k tok/s with rolling checkpoint 258,750; 260k remains
  the next DR target. No R12 code, data, fit, score, or GPU job was authorized.

- **2026-07-15 01:12--01:32** — **Two mathematics-only lanes close coherent profile extension and
  arbitrary late-query compression as invention claims.** `R12_COHERENT_ACTION_THEORY.md` proves an explicit
  isometric embedding of any bounded nonexpansive event-monoid action into a hyperconvex sup-norm function
  space. Updates are coordinate substitutions, every relation holds globally, a merge fiber of diameter
  `Delta` has optimal radius `Delta/2`, and grid quantization preserves relations with no word-length error
  growth. The cost defeats the intended claim: the displayed unrestricted construction uses `|X|*|A|`
  coordinates, while the reduced
  form assumes an event-closed observable profile and collapses to predictive-state, Koopman-pullback,
  equivariant-representation, semigroup-linearization, and rate-distortion machinery. A cardinality-minimal
  three-point obstruction proves that independently nonexpansive generator extensions need not preserve even
  `a^2=1` in a prescribed ambient space. Independently, `R12_CLOSED_LATE_QUERY_NO_GO.md` proves that every
  closed post-commit process is a uniform transducer and internally generated computation adds no source
  mutual information. Exact late INDEX needs `n` retained bits; error `epsilon` still needs at least
  `n(1-h2(epsilon))`. Longer internal thinking cannot reconstruct arbitrary discarded context. R12 now targets
  a resource advantage on structured residuals: learnability, dynamic sparsity, amortized verification, noise
  stability, or another named cost. No code, data, fit, score, CPU board, or GPU job was authorized. The
  protected flagship remained healthy through step 259,520 at ~284.52k tok/s; 260k remains the next DR target.

- **2026-07-15 01:32--02:02** — **Exact 260k is remotely durable; the Mac mirror is transport-blocked,
  not lost.** Job `686732` wrote `ckpt_0260000.pt` at exactly 260,000 updates, or 136,314,880,000 nominal
  update tokens. It was copied without clobbering to Newton `best_step260000.pt`; both remote files match at
  MD5 `301082250e15c26820790ec7ff7730a0`. The resumable Mac transfer reached 1,035,468,800 of 1,076,598,762
  bytes before the SSH route closed. Preserve `train/flagship_out/ckpt_0260000.pt.part` exactly as-is; after
  Newton connectivity returns, use `sftp reget`, require the remote MD5, and only then rename it. The last
  pre-milestone training observation was healthy at step 259,520, ~284.52k tok/s, loss 1.5095, gnorm 0.09.
  No R12 implementation or GPU capability experiment was authorized.

- **2026-07-15 02:02--02:23** — **Secret-shared causal bootstrapping is formally rejected before
  execution.** The construction yields a valid tight memory theorem: two finite-group shares separately hide
  a target, exact sequential recovery needs at least `log2|G|` retained bits, and a running product keeps that
  memory independent of sequence length. It does not yield reasoning. The late share is a one-time-padded
  answer; the transition-mask version is a gauge-transformed Cayley recurrence; arbitrary latent bijections
  remain behaviorally indistinguishable; relabeling with support is meta-learning; and masked behavior places
  no constraint on distinguishable unmasked inputs. `R12_SECRET_SHARED_CAUSAL_BOOTSTRAP_NO_GO.md` freezes the
  proof, equivalence dossier, and gate-4 rejection. It may serve only as a balanced causal-memory control. No
  CPU falsifier, Shohin fit, or H100 experiment was authorized.

- **2026-07-15 02:23** — **Structured residuals yield a real resource separation, but the first
  positive family is an established linear control.** Every exact realization maps onto the residual quotient,
  so retained information remains at least `log2|R|`. The bit-flip family nevertheless represents `2^r`
  residual states with `r` Hankel coordinates, `O(1)` updates and queries, and a polynomial presentation,
  exponentially smaller and cheaper to certify than an arbitrary `r*2^r` transition table. The gain is in
  description and global verification, not memory, and it reduces exactly to weighted automata/OOM/PSR
  machinery. A parallel context law gives `ceil(log2 p(n))` retained bits for a source language with `p(n)`
  admissible blocks; low entropy alone does not make online encoding tractable. The next admissible theorem is
  a bounded-precision nonlinear action that is polynomially learnable from ordinary noisy traces while a named
  unstructured comparator is not. `R12_STRUCTURED_RESIDUAL_RESOURCE_LAW.md` freezes the proofs and boundary.
  No CPU neural board or H100 experiment was authorized.

- **2026-07-15 02:25** — **Finite axiom/relation loss is rejected as a standalone route to
  extrapolation.** The presentation theorem is valid: generator maps satisfying every defining relation on
  their complete domains factor through the presented category and therefore determine all word actions. But
  target identification already requires each generator to be covered on a determining set for a restricted
  hypothesis class. An unrestricted neural updater can patch any unvisited state-generator transition while
  preserving every finite relation and interchange test, then fail on the first unseen word reaching it;
  trivial, conjugate, and nonfaithful actions add further ambiguity. Relations certify already identified local
  maps rather than identify them. `R12_AXIOMATIC_PRESENTATION_NO_GO.md` freezes the theorem, finite-test no-free-
  lunch boundary, resource ledger, and prior-art collapse. No CPU falsifier or Shohin fit was authorized.

- **2026-07-15 02:30** — **Three further R12 boundaries are frozen before compute.** Matroid
  closure supplies a real deduction target: exact states are flats and fixed rank-`r` flat readouts have VC
  dimension exactly `r`, but binary projective families still require roughly `r^2/4` exact state bits and the
  learnability theorem assumes the matroid class. Local reversible `k`-bit rules give a polynomial noisy-sample
  theorem and a nonlinear action whose balanced-readout Hankel family has full rank `2^n`; however, the result
  is handed wire coordinates, affected tuples, and rule sharing, all destroyed by arbitrary latent conjugacy.
  Unrestricted MDL is rejected: exact success assumes a characteristic set against every shorter incorrect
  program, delayed failure costs only `O(log L)`, the reference machine changes the ranking, and ideal shortest-
  total-program selection is uncomputable. `R12_MATROID_CLOSURE_TARGET.md`,
  `R12_LOCAL_REVERSIBLE_RULE_CONTROL.md`, and `R12_MDL_IDENTIFIABILITY_NO_GO.md` freeze these results. No CPU or
  GPU experiment was authorized; current pure-math lanes attack hidden-coordinate identifiability, runtime-noise
  correction, matroid learnability from ordinary traces, and verifiable witness state.

- **2026-07-15 02:34** — **A conjugacy theorem closes unsupervised discovery of latent
  locality from ordinary adaptive traces.** Simultaneously conjugating hidden dynamics and interventions and
  pulling back the observation kernel leaves every adaptive transcript distribution unchanged, so coordinates,
  support size, sparsity, and locality are not identifiable in a conjugacy-closed class. A finite positive result
  recovers product axes from a complete family of opaque atomic resets using their noncommutation graph and fixed
  sets, but those resets already carry a coordinate signature and collapse to interventional causal representation
  learning. `R12_HIDDEN_COORDINATE_IDENTIFIABILITY_NO_GO.md` freezes the proof and prior-art boundary. R12 now
  requires a task-native observable asymmetry that breaks conjugacy without labeling the hidden axes. No CPU
  falsifier or neural fit was authorized.

- **2026-07-15 02:40** — **The 260k Mac disaster-recovery mirror is complete and the next two
  theory lanes close before compute.** The rolling numbered Newton file aged out, but promoted
  `best_step260000.pt` remained intact at MD5 `301082250e15c26820790ec7ff7730a0`. The existing 1,035,468,800-byte
  local partial matched the remote promoted prefix exactly, was resumed rather than restarted, and became local
  `train/flagship_out/ckpt_0260000.pt`, 1,076,597,546 bytes with the same MD5. Flagship `686732` remained healthy
  through step 261,560 at ~283.94k tok/s; one gnorm skip at 261,479 recovered immediately. Matroid closure now has
  an exponential passive no-go via sparse-paving circuit-hyperplanes, while fixed-field positives reduce to
  matrix discovery plus Gaussian elimination. Exact bounded-precision noise stability requires an error-correcting
  code with distance at least `2t+1`; decode-compute-reencode is the converse, and noisy repair is ordinary fault-
  tolerant computation. `R12_NOISE_STABLE_ACTION_NO_GO.md` and the strengthened
  `R12_MATROID_CLOSURE_TARGET.md` freeze these boundaries. No CPU falsifier or neural fit was authorized.

- **2026-07-15 02:44** — **Observable event commutators fail to identify independent reasoning
  registers.** Noncommutation components generate pairwise commuting transition subgroups, but only a central
  product unless cross-intersections vanish. Even a true group direct product need not factor residual state: an
  `S_3 x S_3` left-right action has a diagonal stabilizer and one six-state orbit rather than two independent
  six-state factors. Exact unrestricted commutation tests also require extensional state coverage; complete-table
  positives reduce to established group, automata, trace-monoid, or Cartesian-graph decomposition.
  `R12_COMMUTATOR_FACTORIZATION_NO_GO.md` freezes the theorem and no-CPU verdict. The live theory lanes now test
  higher-order holonomy, dynamic interaction width, query-kernel factor congruences, and verifiable witness state.

- **2026-07-15 02:45** — **Gauge-invariant holonomy identifies a connection orbit, not the
  current causal state.** For a finite compact matrix action, spanning-tree gauge fixing and joint loop traces can
  reconstruct fundamental transports up to simultaneous conjugation. Complete signatures then reduce exactly to
  ordinary operator recurrence; incomplete signatures merge actions that differ on later words. State-independent
  loops cannot distinguish future-separable points in one fiber, while adding state-dependent continuation probes
  is PSR/OOM state. `R12_HOLONOMY_STATE_NO_GO.md` freezes the finite collapse test and no-CPU verdict. The vacated
  lane now attacks active self-generated determining experiments with only verifier feedback.

- **2026-07-15 02:49** — **Causal-Address Revelation is the first R12 proposal to reach
  independent finite-falsifier audit.** For `H` private arbitrary maps `[m]->[m]` and late interval queries,
  exact retained memory remains `Hm log2(m)` bits. But a simultaneous full-chain protocol needs
  `(1+(H-1)m) log2(m)` activated source bits, while `H` adaptive rounds reveal one address/value at a time using
  `H log2(m)`. The `H=m=2` witness is three versus two bits; translation maps erase the gap and are the mandatory
  positive collapse control. This is a pointer-chasing round separation, not a new complexity class. The R12
  claim under audit is that iterative thought can reduce query-conditioned state activation even though it cannot
  create information or compress arbitrary context. `R12_CAUSAL_ADDRESS_REVELATION.md` freezes the theorem,
  assumptions, prior-art boundary, and draft CPU contract. No implementation is authorized until an independent
  adversary freezes fair centralized-memory, randomized, attention, parameter, FLOP, and activation controls.

- **2026-07-15 02:55** — **Independent audit rejects CAR before compute and three adjacent
  routes close cleanly.** CAR's simultaneous-message lower bound is valid only for physically private banks.
  It mixed all-interval and full-chain query families, and a fair centralized model can precompute a composite
  table or segment tree; a depth-matched Transformer already has adaptive routing rounds. The proposed CPU board
  would therefore force a lazy-evaluation win and is canceled before implementation.
  `R12_QUERY_KERNEL_FACTORIZATION_NO_GO.md` reduces task-native modular coordinates to subdirect products and
  factor congruences; `R12_ACTIVE_VERIFIER_QUERY_NO_GO.md` reduces self-generated determining experiments to
  target-coupled membership/equivalence oracles and generalized binary search; and
  `R12_DYNAMIC_FRONTIER_NO_GO.md` reduces adaptive context width to pathwidth/frontier dynamic programming and
  structure-aware recurrence. The verified local raw-260k interaction independently remains **1/7 initial,
  0/7 review, 1/7 supplied-fact, 0/7 valid state reuse** (SHA-256
  `42590202834294cea182821f09613503c5ca91f6a1676d020d9f2cc2100c0aac`), with the same arithmetic, base,
  sequential-state, sorting, insertion, and Python failures as earlier checkpoints. Flagship `686732` remained
  healthy through step 262,060 at ~283.71k tok/s. No R12 CPU or GPU implementation is authorized.

- **2026-07-15 03:04** — **Two old controls are reactivated only to establish a hard empirical
  floor for future inventions.** Local protocol/job/evaluator contracts pass. Newton inputs remain immutable and
  hash-matched: complete-basis DRS train/held-out SHA-256
  `b785866bf24813272d346e4a3bb717d4156b01a59a4dd8ccaf450733267368f6` /
  `f2fcfcae41b55aa82dd360036bd8c9c00ed6e4ca442debec1c85ed282e50dfe1`, and factorized static-tape/
  recurrent-register SHA-256 `82245615f0849c3270f99f2db85c604ff46cb2c3dfb14f0ab3660dff3eb0d3ec` /
  `a699ac58ad8184f4dc23dcfa317cd6e7b8f7d4ef453dcbf1ae21201901e0948a`. Isolated one-H100 chains are
  **`689496 -> 689497`** for DRS v3 and **`689498 -> 689499`** for STRR, both from immutable
  `best_step200000.pt`, fresh output paths, and full 300-per-regime evaluations over recombination widths 4/6
  and unseen width 8. They share no flagship writer, corpus, or output. This is a matched control on transition
  coverage and copy burden, not an R12 mechanism or novelty claim.

- **2026-07-15 03:10** — **Closed self-deliberation and polynomial-coded action close before
  compute.** If every internally generated question and answer is a function of the same observed data and
  private randomness, the complete deliberation transcript has zero conditional mutual information with the
  target and composes into a one-shot learner with identical risk; a target-answering channel is ordinary active
  learning. Separately, bounded-degree finite-field actions are exactly learnable by interpolation, adversarial
  transition noise is corrected exactly when the evaluation code has distance at least `2e+1`, and
  decode-compute-reencode gives robust length extrapolation. But a fairly matched universal recurrent comparator
  executes the identical algorithm, so this is a rigorous nonlinear/ECC control rather than a novel mechanism.
  `R12_CLOSED_DELIBERATION_NO_GO.md` and `R12_POLYNOMIAL_CODED_ACTION_NO_GO.md` freeze both verdicts. The old
  matched DRS/STRR chains remain pending H100 capacity with zero training steps consumed; flagship `686732`
  remains healthy through step 262,510 at ~283.63k tok/s.

- **2026-07-15 03:16** — **The R12 charter's collapse rule was vacuous and is corrected.** Every
  bounded finite-precision mechanism has a finite unrolling, so treating extensional unrolling as automatic
  rejection made the gate accept nothing. A comparator class allowed to contain and copy the candidate likewise
  cannot establish a strict separation. Gate 4 now rejects only resource-preserving reductions, with parameters,
  retained bits, precision, source bytes, training examples, oracle calls, training/inference FLOPs, sequential
  depth, external memory, and external execution all counted. Genuine information, conjugacy, off-support, and
  passive-sample no-go theorems remain unchanged. `R12_GATE_VACUITY_AND_WGRQ_PREREG.md` records a draft
  Witness-Guided Residual Quotienting protocol: source/KV deletion after query-blind commitment, counted
  distinguishing-witness supervision, transition closure, causal-state interchange, and source-free multi-query
  reuse on two exact families. It is awaiting independent equivalence audit; no CPU code or job is authorized yet.

- **2026-07-15 03:20** — **Self-authenticating causal state reduces exactly to coding plus a trust
  boundary.** Detecting `t` bit corruptions requires distance at least `t+1`; correcting them requires `2t+1`.
  Replacing one valid state with another cannot be detected by a public self-check without a trusted root, key,
  counter, checkpoint, or prior state. A recurrent control with identical bits and repair work runs the same
  decode-compute-reencode path, so the reduction preserves the corrected R12 resource vector exactly.
  `R12_SELF_AUTHENTICATING_STATE_NO_GO.md` freezes the verdict; no CPU board is authorized.

- **2026-07-15 03:24** — **Average-case query-aware context compression has a tight but classical
  boundary.** For independent source bits, sublinear retained state with vanishing average late-query error exists
  exactly when asymptotically all query mass concentrates on a sublinear coordinate set. A power-law recency
  workload obtains the tight rate with a sliding-window cache; discarded-coordinate and worst-case error remain
  one half. `R12_QUERY_DISTRIBUTIONAL_CONTEXT_NO_GO.md` freezes the weighted-INDEX/rate-distortion proof and
  resource-preserving streaming collapse. No CPU board is authorized.

- **2026-07-15 03:28--03:33** — **Canonical naming, compiler-prior, and active-witness audits narrow
  WGRQ to an empirical optimization hypothesis.** A finite minimal Moore quotient can be canonically reconstructed
  from observable residual rows and short distinguishing suffixes, but hidden coordinates remain unidentifiable.
  Any tied recurrent evaluator has a uniform acyclic compiler preserving samples, learned bits, precision, work,
  sequential depth, and scheduled state, so recurrence itself supplies no fair statistical separation. Adaptive
  target queries can beat passive/random schedules (`Theta(log N)` versus `Theta(N)` on thresholds), but a fair
  active answer-only learner replays the identical transcript and derives the identical quotient labels. WGRQ is
  therefore not a new state, algorithm, or oracle advantage. The draft CPU board is blocked until it freezes
  oracle-response information, teacher search work, a delayed-witness family, committed-history episodes, dense/
  active/symbolic controls, and a process-level source barrier. The existing flat SFT corpus also cannot carry a
  synthetic residual claim: `R12_CERTIFIED_LANGUAGE_BRIDGE_BOUNDARY.md` requires a future-reflecting certificate
  map for any later math/code/logic bridge.

- **2026-07-15 03:38** — **Manual interaction finds a narrow real procedure at raw 260k, then confirms
  its boundary on a sealed set.** The exploratory continuation-mode artifact first showed a complete state chain
  under a textbook continuation. A fixed-seed 20-case confirmation (five each multiply-subtract, base conversion,
  sequential state, and modular update) was generated before model loading and preserved verbatim. A numbered-
  header assessor bug was corrected without regenerating outputs by a separate hash-bound assessor. Strict first-
  segment finals are direct **4/20**, bare expression **1/20**, and worked continuation **8/20**. Sequential add/
  multiply/subtract is **4/5 direct and 5/5 worked**, with every intermediate present; multiply-subtract is 1/5
  worked, modular 2/5 worked, and base conversion 0/5 in every mode. Transcript SHA-256 is
  `f333c8f54383c411813551bc2001077b88e49514923b76c3cfe0331e9fd6bb47`; assessment SHA-256 is
  `058aa9dafdc741efc181e6377db5d46b233875504b4b4b6d92837a0db71ea62b`. This is narrow procedural competence
  plus severe format/termination brittleness, not broad reasoning. Flagship remained healthy through step 263,270
  at ~283.64k tok/s; both matched DRS/STRR SFTs remain pending priority with zero steps consumed.

- **2026-07-15 03:45--04:00** — **The failed SSC renderer is diagnosed and a real source-free
  composition foothold survives.** The frozen `Current state` / `Next state` SSC scores 0/20 chains because
  raw 260k emits `input_state + 1` on 43/55 calls. A fixed three-format matrix then evaluates every renderer,
  transition, and chain without demonstrations or retries. `Problem/Work` reaches **44/55 atomic transitions
  and 10/20 model-carried chains**, versus 40/55 and 7/20 for `Question/Answer`, and 8/55 and 1/20 for bare
  equations. Sequential state is 15/15 atomic and 5/5 chained. A crossed-state causal diagnostic favors the
  displayed-state continuation in 6/6 cells, minimum summed-logprob margin 0.79386. Artifact SHA-256 values are
  `b33c26b3963296c0d97b2a6d3332c0be18af40f460137c25652b881824a1ca4b` and
  `963177139b6abb333710f0db19a521c341a039fce3f65743ebdd698be6f12170`. This is a renderer-indexed visible-
  state executor plus counted external recurrence, not standalone reasoning.

- **2026-07-15 04:05** — **Both matched local-transition SFTs complete after a bounded preflight
  repair.** Initial DRS/STRR jobs `689496/689498` timed out before training because their 600-second prompt
  preflight imported the full PyTorch SFT module over Lustre. `train/sft_encoding.py` now isolates the pure
  completion encoder; remote smoke takes 1.78 seconds and the prompt-boundary test passes. Resubmitted DRS
  `689524` and STRR `689526` each complete one frozen epoch/1,115 updates from raw 200k. Their locked 900-case
  evaluations `689525` and `689527` are running on evc40 and evc25. The canceled original eval dependencies
  consumed no model calls and created no result artifacts.

- **2026-07-15 04:20** — **WGRQ v1 closes before all 60 fits despite a valid immutable
  acquisition.** Stokes jobs `739105 -> 739106` generate and independently replay-audit 18,432 episodes and
  589,824 one-bit answers. Transcript/ledger/report/audit SHA-256 values are
  `ae2849db5d57fda36e2e2fd634ce6e1d0f11eaed7fefe8d9ce722f016f28295a`,
  `251d85432d845c31ce64da1adae132fa8df8f6a63b5db744654b519f2413c9e8`,
  `12c1e54f23b27f3a97a86857b723fec3573f5d558b7528e1615c55746899befb`, and
  `8f5fac80e0c50bdc807287599f8468194431f3612d6d79a1331f51a073fa2dd4`. A separate adversarial code audit
  then finds that the relation sham crosses declared strata (13,045 equivalent and 13,905 non-equivalent
  mismatches), the trainer can bypass the independent audit, and hand-authored evaluation rows can satisfy the
  scorer. The locked rule therefore closes v1. **No fit was launched.** The 289 MB corpus remains immutable on
  Stokes as negative/audit evidence; do not repair or reuse it under the v1 claim.

- **2026-07-15 04:26** — **A fresh 256-case source-scheduled confirmation is running.** The board
  was generated once from frozen seed `2026071502`, has 64 cases in each of four families and 704 public
  transitions, file SHA-256 `19a84165f15b19911fc8ef229022e47753833d703d77d1e8cc25db9dfc993474`, and canonical
  row hash `4afc6c4b0c271ea2f723078ab183e8d1ac1851fd1728898384ef52275887b0e4`. First job `689533` failed before
  model load because two helper modules were absent on Newton; it made zero model calls and no output. Identical
  resubmission `689535` is running on evc37 against immutable `best_step260000.pt`, with the first 16/256 cases
  logged. Flagship `686732` remains healthy through step 264,890 at ~283.38k tok/s.

- **2026-07-15 04:47** — **The first fresh confirmation attempt was invalidated score-blind and
  replaced before producing an artifact.** Adversarial review found that the evaluator needed hardcoded board
  hashes, consistent comma/decimal parsing, removal of an inherited answer-phrase stop, exact call accounting,
  implementation hash stability, and immutable-output enforcement. Local focused/adjacent tests pass 19/19.
  Job `689535` had loaded the older remote source (remote source mtime 04:12, job start 04:17, while the final
  patched local source arrived later), so it was canceled after 104/256 progress without reading scores; its
  exclusive-write result path did not exist. The exact patched evaluator/generator/job hashes now match local and
  Newton, and identical-board job `689542` is running on evc37. No prompt, parser policy, family, threshold, or
  board row changed. In parallel, `R12_SOURCE_DELETED_RESIDUAL_PACKET_PREREG.md` freezes the conditional RSP-C1
  compiler/controller test before any RSP board or data. A five-call raw-260k MPS packet-interface diagnostic is
  preserved at SHA-256 `1ca48442013a69f8fa53e25a0e063ea38063d7cd9e245c731b2b5fa295e1376c`: two fresh
  arithmetic traces are correct, but both packet-update calls repeat prompt material instead of emitting the
  residual packet. Flagship `686732` remains healthy through step 265,730 at ~283.39k tok/s.

- **2026-07-15 05:20--05:45** — **The exact 256-case causal confirmation completes and misses
  one locked gate.** Patched job `689542` executes all 1,920 frozen calls against immutable raw 260k.
  Result SHA-256 is `be2e64c8df2797c3b35c7431b3b6af4d6d7fb3600cd25e5a0371415b45de6a0d`;
  independent assessment SHA-256 is `0e1e49ea864d3958a765e11ac395aac7e2d87a4b9433950b00a3bb213a7933bd`.
  Direct is 16/256, whole `Problem/Work` 9/256, source-scheduled 115/256, and atomic 534/704.
  Scheduler-only/direct-only cells are 101/2 and exact McNemar p is `1.0564819673172401e-27`.
  Base conversion scheduled is 44/64, multiply-subtract 29/64, modular 4/64, sequential 38/64.
  Every integrity gate passes, but sequential misses the preregistered 45/64 floor; no threshold, parser,
  prompt, family, board, or score was changed and no internalization fit advanced. A post-start local
  `model.py` change initially exposed a custody mismatch; the exact runtime loader was recovered from Newton,
  frozen under `train/frozen_sources/source_scheduled_reasoning_confirmation_v1/`, and independently replayed.

- **2026-07-15 05:30--06:00** — **Matched recurrent controls and residual-packet routes close.** DRS
  complete-basis evaluation is first-transition 533/900, transitions 1,259/2,088, finals 63/900, with
  width-8 0/300. STRR is first-transition 365/900, transitions 653/1,537, finals 15/900, also width-8 0/300.
  Their result SHA-256 values are `eb0b15413e7dcf42f27d275a5a922c3f293dbead6c5507ca7910e802d80d9484`
  and `9a8bd97cc5f450b626aed204c47ebb6260e3f1af89e39c8eb959175f9b2adf5f`.
  Contractive packet recurrence has an exact wrong-valid-state no-go and finite FSM collapse; it cannot repair
  a coherent wrong semantic state. Source-deleted residual-packet C1 remains quarantined. C2 is closed first by
  its failed prerequisite and again by an independent reproducibility audit: raw JSON/post-pulse metadata create
  seed grinding, the freeze surface and git-tree binder are incomplete, and evidence is self-attested. No C2
  beacon, seed, board, packing, fit, or evaluation occurred.

- **2026-07-15 06:00--12:20** — **Failure taxonomy identifies controller/termination as the dominant
  autonomous gap; fixed packet likelihood is negative.** Whole `Problem/Work` reaches the answer in 45/256 but
  scores 9/256 because 36 correct trajectories are destroyed by continuation and the last-integer parser.
  Exclusive failures are 96 wrong first operation, 37 wrong first arithmetic, 71 loop/replay, and seven later
  failures. A conservative loop signature fires in 214/256; all 1,920 calls hit their cap and none emits EOS.
  Remainder remains a true executor defect at atomic 4/64 and scheduled-local 7/64. The frozen six-prompt updater
  likelihood result (SHA-256 `4ca100029806c933ba1d3137044c040b468d380ae9bb9f5efeadcbc949374525`)
  has 0/6 correct normalized, total, candidate-plus-EOS, or EOS wins. Natural prompts prefer arithmetic
  continuation; packet prompts prefer the unchanged packet. Independent replay reproduces all 30 forwards with
  maximum token/EOS log-probability difference 0.0. Do not build the next mechanism around packet rewriting.

- **2026-07-15 12:20--12:30** — **280k is durable and the next mechanistic gate is live.** The 270k
  numbered file aged out before promotion, while protected 260k remained intact. At step 280,000 the watcher
  promoted Newton `best_step280000.pt`; the resumable local transfer initially hit a full Mac disk, then completed
  after the user authorized removal of superseded local DR copies. Local/Newton MD5 is
  `60a921e4e7e7c11c77dc7334f987f6fd`; local SHA-256 is
  `a6f48b2b6ce633dea77fdf09691dd892b0ab096f1830b30e09e28cecf47f079b`. Flagship is healthy through
  280,410 at ~282.20k tok/s. Frozen operation-cursor and future-Jacobian jobs first stalled before CUDA on
  evc29/evc30 and wrote no result; a real CUDA allocation passed on idle evc42, so score-blind replacements
  `689717/689718` now run there against immutable 260k. Their result decides whether a causal operation signal
  exists before any model-owned controller canary is authorized.

- **2026-07-15 12:36--12:38** — **The strict cursor interface is wholly malformed and the causal
  Jacobian probe fails closed.** Operation-cursor job `689717` completes all 64 cases / 176 transitions / 528
  calls, but strict whole-response JSON parses `0/528`; all 16,896 sampled tokens are consumed at the 32-token
  cap and EOS stops are `0/528`. Result SHA-256 is
  `5ba772ec68aaa445d1252022f00285fa83b3403f3376437d4386d143619da681`. This establishes severe interface and
  termination failure but cannot separate operation selection from formatting, operand emission, generation,
  and stopping; no semantic score is salvaged. Future-Jacobian job `689718` reaches all 12 primary cases, then
  aborts on the first replication case because the norm-matched swap is below the frozen minimum relative norm.
  It writes no score artifact and is classified inconclusive/failed closed; preserved log SHA-256 is
  `60e26d88432675f233b3b1a2c58e0d06814d12eee03bacb2954ad15a0d2c3804`. Neither result authorizes a fit.

- **2026-07-15 15:35** — **The score-blind operation-likelihood decomposition completes and
  rejects a pre-existing cursor-aware controller.** After the score-free receipt was mirrored, validated,
  committed, and pushed as `34573c1`, job `689796`'s hash-bound result was released locally. Full source plus
  cursor is **80/176**, versus **64/176** for both literal-suffix controls. The paired 16 gains / 0 losses prove
  that source text changes restricted operation logits, but the model changes its prediction across cursors in
  only **1/64** multi-step sources. It predicts `add` 145 times and `subtract` 31 times, never `multiply` or
  `remainder`; 15/16 multiply-subtract sources receive `subtract` at both steps. This is a family-word cue, not
  schedule recovery. Result SHA-256 is `772050a9c30c229ff200f81895a01377c63a7e07a8ccc7e944afc54779bca5b6`;
  receipt SHA-256 is `73e4241a00e40d4ed7491039f4b9410931a5e46164dc59c86ae07893857b3dd1`.
  No full controller fit is authorized. The next canary must induce cursor-dependent action logits with
  same-lexicon operation-order twins and preserve the raw atomic executor. Flagship `686732` remains healthy
  through step 286,240 at ~282.43k tok/s; local/Newton 280k checkpoint hashes remain identical.

- **2026-07-15 15:40** — **Local checkpoint inventory compacted after 280k verification.** The Mac
  was at 97% disk usage. Newton `best_step166250.pt`, `best_step180000.pt`, and `best_step190000.pt` were
  independently re-hashed at MD5 `1b57c99aca966546d4d9aea7827d6ebd`,
  `a592a8bd46163eb1427fe64460be0c6a`, and `3e195aaf44a14259797c49d7f80d9c7f`, matching the local files.
  The obsolete local 59k optimizer fallback and redundant local 166.25k/180k/190k copies were then removed.
  Retained local anchors are model-only 60k and full 170k, 200k, 252.5k, 260k, and 280k. This reclaimed about
  4 GiB without deleting any Newton scientific anchor or the latest recovery checkpoint.

- **2026-07-15 16:20** — **Cursor-action theory survives only as a training-protocol hypothesis; the
  corrected CPU mechanics board is frozen.** Independent theorem and prior-art audits prove the proposed
  self-advancing cursor is an ordinary finite-state recurrence/hard pointer and reject primitive novelty. The
  surviving bounded hypothesis uses a 192-scalar centered three-bit cursor sidecar at final-block head 0 plus
  operation-order orbit/interchange losses, compared against information-identical ordinary loss, relation sham,
  a trainable fixed-code source-only arm, a favorable 512-parameter cursor table, and a favorable 640-parameter
  text-cursor LoRA. Pre-board reviews caught and repaired renderer/content confounding, gold-field exposure,
  incomplete HALT/EOS state, canonical-order and boolean-integer audit gaps, mutable implementation identity,
  duplicate-key/symlink custody, and underspecified pair counts/tolerances. Implementation commit `bde30db` then
  generated one read-only 600-cell board and independent report. Board/audit SHA-256 values are
  `02a202070efa45f14c4e53b7d7f532d98791c7eef9daf438b02d31cc0ec6ab95` and
  `c64951a1369b3dd29ca7e651840e5644e8445c7236cf994c3e54f05ca4a844b2`; row SHA-256 is
  `64710b7ca5f5da910f4e784b86c3f5c600a488c0899d070c4d8798ba6836435a`. Exact symbolic scores are
  oracle 600/600, cursor-only 240/600, source-only/global/renderer/clamp 120/600, and five-cycle derangement
  0/600. Eight mutation-focused unit tests and Ruff pass. This is geometry/collapse evidence only: no neural
  fit, autonomous reasoning claim, or H100 canary is authorized until the loader, 192-parameter sidecar, matched
  arms, and score-blind confirmation contract are implemented and CPU-tested. Flagship `686732` is independently
  healthy through step 287,910 at ~282.37k tok/s; 280k remains hash-matched local/Newton and 290k is the next DR
  target.

- **2026-07-15 16:30** — **The frozen-base cursor sidecar is implemented and passes CPU regression,
  but remains capability-untested.** `train/model.py` now accepts an optional final-block/head-zero Q delta
  without adding state-dict parameters or changing the omitted-argument path. The separately serializable
  centered-three-bit sidecar has exactly 192 trainable scalars at Shohin's 64-wide head; the base is frozen.
  Six focused tests pass strict old-state loading and zero-delta parity, event-FSM and prompt-boundary alignment,
  phase gating, base-gradient isolation, and cached-decode/full-replay equivalence. Existing causal-KV,
  batched-generation, recurrent-inference, and masked-loss regressions also pass, as do `py_compile` and Ruff.
  This closes implementation mechanics only. No H100 fit may run until the disjoint data splits, all six matched
  arms, exact loader allowlist, immutable hashes, and score-blind receipt are frozen. Direct Newton custody finds
  `686732` healthy through step 288,210 at ~282.36k tok/s; short gnorm bursts recovered, latest rolling checkpoint
  is 288,000, and 290k remains the next durable target.

- **2026-07-15 17:26** — **290k is durable and adversarial canary defects were removed before any
  fit.** `686732` remains RUNNING on evc34 through step 290,110 at ~282.47k tok/s, loss 1.6764, gnorm 0.12,
  and LR 0.0012. Exact 290k is 152,043,520,000 nominal update tokens. Newton `ckpt_0290000.pt` and promoted
  read-only `best_step290000.pt` match the local read-only `train/flagship_out/ckpt_0290000.pt`: 1,076,597,546
  bytes, MD5 `81b9db27e19f82d86c170d7159afba41`, SHA-256
  `d93128affd1cb83fc3e7034ec045dbb1817be5d2cbbf866ff3b2002ef93e2a31`. The next DR target is 300k.
  Independent canary review found operand-range leakage, contradictory cursor exposure, stale board identity,
  inactive-capacity accounting, right-padding placement, scoring, serialization, and release-custody gaps. The
  immutable mechanics board identity was repaired by restoring its normative prereg bytes and moving results to
  a separate document; independent replay again passes all 600 rows. The neural data contract now uses Latin
  operand rotations with identical operation marginals and distinguishes prompt-row tokens, cursor side-state,
  and gold-only labels. Eight sidecar/model tests, seven generator/auditor mutation tests, four existing
  inference/loss regression suites, `py_compile`, and Ruff pass. No H100 selector fit has run: the typed loader,
  six-arm matched trainer, independent full-vocabulary/restricted evaluator, and score-blind release remain the
  explicit blockers.

- **2026-07-15 18:41** — **The R12 neural-canary implementation candidate closes the prior code and
  custody blockers; no fit has run.** The strict loader exposes only prompt tokens plus the declared cursor (or
  the frozen text suffix for the text control), while keeping relation metadata and gold labels in separate
  structures. One serial trainer now fits orbit-interchange, ordinary-loss, relation-sham, source-only,
  cursor-table, and text-cursor LoRA arms from immutable raw 260k. The fixed contract is seed `2026071506`, four
  epochs, 288 units/epoch, 1,152 updates/arm, 60 rows/update, and every train cell exactly three times per epoch.
  Full-vocabulary CE is primary; centered restricted logits define the relation losses; the sham applies the
  same graph with a local `+1 mod 5` mapping. A read-only manifest binds all six adapter hashes, initialization,
  update/parameter counts, and compute proxies. The full-model evaluator is score-blind and the independent
  scorer re-hashes the complete chain, uses full-vocabulary unique-top-1 for the selector decision, and leaves
  executor plus one-call DONE/EOS gates pending even after a selector pass. Confirmation denominators are now
  exact: 19,200 directed cursor pairs, 2,880 affected adjacent pairs, 4,320 unaffected adjacent pairs, and
  9,600 renderer pairs. Forty-seven focused tests, `py_compile`, Ruff, both Slurm shell syntax checks, and
  `git diff --check` pass. Direct Newton custody independently confirms protected job `686732` RUNNING on evc34
  through step 292,510 at about 282.43k tok/s. Next actions are clean implementation commit/push, immutable
  canary generation plus independent audit, and only then an isolated one-H100 six-arm fit.

- **2026-07-15 20:19--21:05** — **R12 cursor-action v1 completes under full custody and is a
  decisive neural-selector NO-GO.** Implementation commit `4dfcec195477c23d9e88276d58030d373bc2db6c`
  generated read-only canary SHA-256 `baf985855c396f63dffba1e09733a7372bd8b29c852cb5b9f482b4d59de714a1`
  and independent audit SHA-256 `5deb9dc396e3c8d99f32b9f0e14482d288cff9d82145582665569c911a802e5d`.
  Persistent PyTorch imports over Lustre were too slow for bounded cold starts, so build `689927` froze a
  node-local Miniforge/Torch runtime tar at SHA-256
  `af7da54fd23ac1f7a64766438ba72d14591ae96d495da2306cc535da875d7f7c`; independent CPU smoke `689929`
  verified its hash, extraction, imports, and module origin. Six-arm H100 job `689932` then completed on evc30
  in 3m23s: four epochs and 1,152 updates per arm, read-only manifest SHA-256
  `8c499c215ade7be26ac75ea4e50cc5b335edd80f3bd5eb2225eb0166eb5bc13e`, shared initialization and exact
  compute ledgers for the four matched 192-scalar arms, and immutable adapter hashes. Serial score-blind array
  `689936` completed all six 4,800-row / 450-forward tasks without restart. The twelve raw/receipt artifacts and
  six adapters were mirrored byte-for-byte, committed and pushed as `51d2cd4` before score release.
  Independent scorer SHA-256 output is
  `88a5e0e86cd4228fe3dd82282efae910fb36634e097f7e4de599d7c008315cc0` after 20,000 paired cluster
  bootstrap replicates. Orbit interchange, ordinary loss, relation sham, source only, and the favorable cursor
  table all score **960/4,800 restricted, 0/4,800 full vocabulary, 0/960 exact groups, and 0/19,200 directed
  switches**. Text-LoRA is 973/4,800 restricted but also zero full-vocabulary and exact groups. Treatment cursor
  interventions move restricted logits by mean L-infinity about 0.10, versus a median 2.54-logit action-token
  deficit to the full-vocabulary winner; QK-normalized final-head Q-only actuation is too weak, and the stronger
  text perturbation still fails source/cursor binding. `R12_COUNTERFACTUAL_CURSOR_ACTION_NEURAL_RESULT.md`
  freezes the decision and diagnosis. Do not tune v1 confirmation. The next admissible work uses only the
  existing train/development split to separate joint representation availability from action-logit actuation;
  a fresh confirmation is required if both gates pass. Protected flagship `686732` remained untouched and was
  healthy through step 296,850 at ~282.35k tok/s; 300k remains the next DR target.

- **2026-07-15 21:38--21:43** — **The confirmation-free final-token readout diagnostic closes with
  a second bounded NO-GO.** A deterministic projection built 5,760 train and 960 development cells while
  physically omitting confirmation; independent replay froze view/audit SHA-256 values
  `24abd93737be57c6792a1d44c8f2e3a28d7c5fbc1666b083383350f410ce6ec9` and
  `33fb4792ed0a8027d49de157c295cb9ba651cdd9c59ab5cfa04a71e99af8ea25`. Implementation commit
  `e2e4bb703304ebe2ce11554c8b7c97ef0d3aa928` staged all inputs and an exported source tree node-locally.
  Isolated H100 job `689952` completed the scientific program on evc30 in about one minute and atomically froze
  result SHA-256 `fda4fc47f63ffae0f1b085e527230b3242d8899649dbefb8f8b50d72cbaae433`. Pre/post joint readouts reach
  98.75%/97.43% on train but only 43.13%/41.67% on new operand/renderers, versus 40% cursor-only, and both have
  0/192 exact groups. Two-scalar frozen-readout calibration needs beta about +21 and median L-infinity 88.76/67.95,
  forces action-token wins, but cannot repair wrong class selection. This rejects a simple final-selector linear
  code; it does not reject distributed token-level state. Slurm recorded FAILED only because the post-result
  cleanup trap could not delete the deliberately read-only exported tree; the complete result was already
  fsynced, read-only, hash-verified, and mirrored. Cleanup is repaired without rerunning the science. Next bounded
  candidate is a cursor-conditioned token-tape retrieval probe with matched controls; any v2 must withhold
  permutations and use fresh confirmation.

- **2026-07-15 22:08--22:18** — **The stronger distributed token-tape diagnostic also closes as an
  external-cursor NO-GO.** Implementation commit `2778d7999ce3539866c2df80d6a5dc4f975361af` was transferred
  to Newton as a minimal independently reconstructed object pack, and every committed dependency was verified
  before submission. Isolated H100 job `689976` completed cleanly on evc44 in 87 seconds. Its 9,815,027-byte,
  mode-0444 result was mirrored locally with SHA-256
  `7065401b13fd83b8a5b514be9a9b2a8cd5158af39abfa5464df43b368bd825e1`. All three shared and all three
  cursor-specific deep probes fit train at or above 99%, so optimization is conclusive. Shared development
  scores are 41.25%, 50.42%, and 48.33%; cursor-specific scores are 56.98%, 57.81%, and 57.50%. Controls are
  embedding 40%, position 40%, source derangement 38.96%, source-only 20%, and cursor-only 40%. The favorable
  family reaches 72.40--81.25% at cursor zero and 100% deterministic DONE, but only 21.88--47.92% at later
  operation cursors and 3--11/192 exact groups. Deep prompt states contain weak first-clause semantics but not a
  renderer-invariant operation-order address. `R12_CURSOR_TOKEN_TAPE_RESULT.md` freezes the claim boundary.
  Close the oracle-cursor/readout branch; derive and finitely falsify an internally updated state-transport
  mechanism under the R12 charter before any further architecture or H100 fit. Protected flagship `686732`
  remained untouched and RUNNING on evc34.

- **2026-07-15 22:24--22:33** — **Adversarial audit narrows the token-tape conclusion before any
  follow-on.** The numeric artifact, all 960 saved development predictions, 14 serialized probe-state hashes,
  input/code bindings, and frozen decision replay exactly. The earlier branch-wide wording was too broad. The
  source-only 20% control is automatic because one cursor-independent prediction must match exactly one of five
  targets per source; it cannot detect leakage. The cursor-specific lift lacks cursor-specific matched controls,
  raw/RMS arms did not reach the 99% train-fit condition, and the code tests only pre-final single-query
  attention plus a linear decoder. Post-final, multi-query, nonlinear, and 24-way order access remain open.
  `R12_CURSOR_TOKEN_TAPE_RESULT.md` now states only the supported narrow no-go. The complete Slurm log is
  preserved mode-0444 at SHA-256
  `246976f5177e9e790ebf3e3208e9ad7aafb57c298a550e13b77bf379f0a58b42`. No numerical rerun is needed.
  Any v1.1 must use fresh data and preregister post-final/order-level and cursor-specific controls; it cannot tune
  on the exposed v1 development split.

- **2026-07-15 22:37--22:54** — **Protected flagship completes 300k and the terminal checkpoint is
  fully mirrored.** Two-H100 job `686732` completed on evc34 at exactly step 300,000 after 153,869s. Final
  telemetry is loss 1.6554, gnorm 0.11, LR 0.0005, and 281.959k tok/s. The terminal save is model-only:
  500,448,522 bytes, MD5 `60de77c31b449060ff0417d8db16d3b0`, SHA-256
  `211d6b2cddf0c2cf8b12cb0b2d73f9c4440d85f6f531018080c8afd35b2f66a6`. Newton preserves read-only
  `ckpt_0300000.pt` and `best_step300000.model.pt`; Mac `train/flagship_out/ckpt_0300000.pt` matches byte for
  byte. Exact nominal update tokens are 157,286,400,000 versus 57,826,022,271 mounted manifest tokens; do not
  call the former unique data. The 600k language-balanced relaunch is correctly blocked because the full 25B
  FineWeb replacement and both hash-bound language approvals are absent. Never substitute the 5B pilots.

- **2026-07-15 22:54--23:02** — **Direct raw-300k interaction remains strictly flat; additive forks
  are theorem-rejected before code.** The deterministic seven-case artifact SHA-256 is
  `b9bd46937838c143355f7bedd3ea7395e3c9809c7f278f98ebf0737124bc229e`: initial 1/7, review 0/7,
  verified fact 1/7, state reuse 0/7, identical to raw 200k/260k. One sequential-state response visibly computes
  23 -> 69 -> 49, but raw 190k had already shown that trace before looping, so it is a fragile reappearing mode,
  not monotonic progress. `RAW300K_INTERACTION_RESULT.md` freezes the boundary. Independent theorem review then
  killed additive fork supervision: grouped mean losses have the same population risk/expected gradient as
  ordinary supervision, and bounded forks cannot identify off-horizon behavior. Preserve
  `R12_FORKED_STATE_TRANSPORT_PREREG.md` as a pre-implementation no-go. Replacement PCRT uses a non-additive
  worst-residual objective plus observable Coxeter-relation closure and has an exact sufficient all-length
  theorem, but remains theory-only until adversarial and primary prior-art review pass.

- **2026-07-15 23:02--23:12** — **Independent theorem and prior-art review closes PCRT before code;
  one raw-300k causal-workspace longitudinal repeat is frozen.** The universal generator equation in PCRT
  supplies the complete recursive answer algorithm, so its induction is tautological as a learnability claim.
  Exact generator intertwining already implies every presentation relation; the relation loss is only a finite-
  sample optimization regularizer. The historical approximate bound was false without identity-anchor error,
  and the all-query chart plus known `T_i` is behavioral gold-successor supervision. Predictive-state methods,
  AIDN/MatrixNet relation learning, group DRO, equivariance/homomorphism losses, and interchange intervention
  cover the ingredients. No PCRT CPU or H100 run is authorized. The July 2026 workspace paper nevertheless
  identifies one unanswered measurement: whether a small raw model ever develops a future-verbalizable causal
  workspace. `R12_JACOBIAN_WORKSPACE_LONGITUDINAL_PREREG.md` freezes an exact paired 300k repeat of Shohin's
  failed 200k J-lens gate using identical seeds, layers, code, board, and thresholds. A pass would authorize only
  a fresh causal-swap preregistration; a fail closes raw-Jacobian swaps at 300k.

- **2026-07-15 23:12--23:33** — **The exact raw-300k future-Jacobian longitudinal repeat completes
  and fails its frozen semantic gate; MCBS is theorem-rejected as the successor mechanism.** Infrastructure-only
  attempts `690014/690015` timed out in shared-runtime imports and `690020/690021` lacked `tokenizers`; they wrote
  no scientific output. Hash-bound node-local staging fixes `e2ba68b` and `735050a` left all scientific code,
  seeds, layers, board, and thresholds unchanged. Valid H100 jobs `690028/690030/690031` completed on evc48/41/40.
  The two raw-300k matrices have cosine 0.9546--0.9991 and top-16 overlap 0.8619--0.9960. Frozen layer 25 future
  MRR is 0.0004949 versus immediate 0.0001024, but all 2,304 language/full targets remain 0% top-10 and 0%
  top-100; same-layer raw-200k future MRR was 0.0005352. No semantic workspace emerged under the exact tested
  object and no swap is authorized. The scientific artifact SHA-256 values are
  `dd687d232d41b970816245c80503a4002d9d23ea71b3721ecdc2e764249e9f6a`,
  `17388eaf20971ac777771dc7563ef8d12f7a7d4d14a64af2f0c6f7adaba3e358`, and
  `305186c3e660ec16127fc964b325e3f129471f7f6f6946c8a25677be0f7d39ef`. Independent MCBS review then proves
  that projection preservation and complement ablation recover only the observable quotient of chosen consumers;
  a parity-style motor bundle passes while failing a held-out state query. Preserve MCBS only as a possible
  read-only diagnostic. The next theory must distinguish update-closed reusable state from finite answer tables.

- **2026-07-15 23:33--23:58** — **Fresh direct interaction confirms update/control failure, and an
  impossibility theorem narrows the next experiment to a resource-bounded post-commit protocol.** Six researcher-
  selected greedy prompts on immutable raw 300k score 1/6 semantically and 0/6 under the requested output contract.
  The model answers 17+26 locally but copies `state=n:<integer>` instead of updating 23 by multiplication, returns
  100 for source-deleted 69-20, pattern-copies 7 -> 14 -> 21 instead of 7 -> 13 -> 39, and collapses into empty
  fences or C++ on late-query/control prompts. `RAW300K_FREEFORM_INTERACTION_RESULT.md` freezes the qualitative
  boundary. Independent theory then proves that any finite challenge tree admits a finite source/prefix answer
  table; held-out labels and recoding cannot establish universal state without a complexity/uniformity bound.
  The weakest conditional criterion is generator-complete, separator-complete bisimulation, which is the residual
  quotient rather than a new ontology. `R12_POST_COMMIT_INTERFACE_FALSIFIER_PREREG.md` therefore authorizes only
  an exhaustive CPU harness over `F_17^4`: equal-width state and motor packets must separate at 100% versus exactly
  1/17 after source deletion and post-commit update/consumer/recoding generation. No neural or H100 fit is authorized.

- **2026-07-16 00:06--00:25** — **The exact post-commit interface falsifier passes every frozen
  evaluator gate; PCFT becomes the next theory candidate, not a reasoning result.** The implementation enumerates
  all 83,521 states and freezes equal-width complete-state and public-answer motor packets before challenge
  generation. Eleven exhaustive tests pass after replacing the original declared horizon flag with an executed
  source-free horizon reader. On five public cells both arms are 83,521/83,521; on all 15 decisive
  update/consumer/depth cells the state arm is 83,521/83,521 and motor is exactly 4,913/83,521 = 1/17, unchanged by
  fresh output recoding. Every decisive cell has an explicit motor-packet collision witness; pointer and horizon
  decoys reject. Immutable report SHA-256 is
  `b7309987cb644bdf31273a07193df56226e35d3653257e239632d7bd837415b4`, payload SHA-256 is
  `4a76de6ef7aa4a6441f24973f13dd8ed3b36c059c3514b6bb7a842b659284e61`. Independent adversarial review then
  blocks a neural fit: v1 never transports the packet event by event, source custody is not process-separated,
  output recoding is scorer-side, the padded motor is not entropy-matched, and 64 random fingerprints amount to
  overcomplete state distillation. `R12_PCFT_ADVERSARIAL_AUDIT.md` freezes the NO-GO. The next admissible work is
  only the exact process-separated writer/updater/oracle/reader v2 preregistered in
  `R12_POST_COMMIT_PACKET_TRANSPORT_V2_PREREG.md`. No neural, Shohin, or H100 fit is authorized. Newton's ten
  remaining July 12--13 dependency-held jobs all depended on
  failed predecessors and could not yield valid evidence; they were canceled after dependency audit. The user queue
  is empty, so no hidden GPU consumer can start while the CPU protocol is designed.

- **2026-07-16 00:43--01:50** — **Two v2 precommit canaries are downgraded and the scientific
  harness is repaired before commitment.** The original exhaustive runs were byte-identical, but the implementation
  itself had not been committed before execution, so their former artifact is preserved only as
  `post_commit_packet_transport_v2_precommit_canary.json` and has no result standing. Independent review returned
  REVISE BEFORE COMMIT on seven concrete defects: stale artifact/source binding, in-memory packet streaming instead
  of immutable file transport, parsed-symbol rather than byte-exact comparison, a stale control that skipped every
  event, a privileged horizon role with explicit depth, derangement rather than uniform-nonidentity sampling, and a
  self-asserted phase-order gate. The corrected implementation moves each cell through isolated read-only packet
  files, launches one fresh file-to-file updater per event, gives canonical and horizon readers the same terminal-
  filename interface, caps only the horizon transport at eight events, compares canonical JSONL rows byte-for-byte,
  skips exactly one nonidentity event for stale control, and binds a read-only phase-two manifest to the fsynced
  phase-one manifest. `verify_report` now rejects any scientific commit/source-tree mismatch. Nine local process and
  schema tests pass. Do not run the exhaustive canonical experiment until these scientific paths are committed; then
  require a byte-identical replay and another independent audit. Direct researcher-written conversations are now an
  explicit mandatory gate for every future learned candidate, never a substitute for exact tests and never omitted.

- **2026-07-16 01:50--02:15** — **A second independent precommit review finds five more custody
  defects; all are repaired before the scientific commit.** The first file-based repair still left prior packet
  files visible in shared working directories, loaded the canonical challenge seed into the role executable, did
  not require a second complete run before `pass`, allowed incomplete gate schemas, and derived expected cell/process
  counts from observed output. V2 now has a separate role executable with no challenge seed or v1 generator import.
  Every updater process starts in a fresh directory containing only `packet_in.jsonl`; every reader starts with only
  `terminal_packet.jsonl`; directory listings are recorded and gated. The frozen five-public/15-decisive IDs, depth
  distribution, and exact 5/227/64/40/1 writer/updater/reader/oracle/raw-reader counts are constants rather than
  observations. The canonical command must produce two complete byte-identical core reports before setting its replay
  gate, and the verifier requires the exact top-level and 33-gate schemas. Eleven local unit/process tests pass,
  including seed-free role code, directory isolation, byte-canonical scoring, identity binding, and incomplete-schema
  rejection. No exhaustive canonical run has occurred; precommit execution remains fail-closed.

- **2026-07-16 02:15--02:22** — **The final precommit audit closes three remaining evidence defects
  and returns PASS TO COMMIT.** The final artifact will now embed the entire second core report, including all 337
  second-run subprocess records, and the verifier reconstructs the first pending core to require literal byte
  identity. `verify_evidence_shape` independently rejects empty/fabricated evidence by replaying the frozen cell
  layouts, exact scores, collision/horizon structures, 337 invocation schemas/counts, manifest hash, configuration,
  and seed derivation. Numeric primary/alternate seeds no longer exist as pre-phase-one globals; each is derived only
  after fsync from the immutable phase-one manifest hash and a precommitted domain separator. Twelve local tests pass.
  Independent static verdict: PASS TO COMMIT. GPU use remains unrestricted. Raw 200k-to-300k flatness blocks only
  treating undifferentiated compute, broad SFT, or sweeps as the reasoning hypothesis itself. Architecture/data
  mechanisms that pass exact CPU gates and fresh direct-conversation gates should earn the smallest falsifying fit,
  then scale aggressively when the evidence supports them.

- **2026-07-16 02:25--02:31** — **The first properly post-commit v2 execution fails closed and adds
  regression defect 16.** Scientific commit `7a0b98c` passed identity verification and began the exhaustive run,
  but stopped before report assembly when the seed-independence gate reread phase-one packet paths after their
  temporary directory had been destroyed. No canonical JSON was written. The repair retains replayed writer bytes
  in memory and compares their SHA-256 values to the immutable phase-one manifest, so the gate no longer depends on
  expired paths. A new cleanup regression deletes the packet files before evaluating the helper and tests both the
  valid and mutated payload; 13/13 local tests pass. Commit the correction before another canonical attempt.

- **2026-07-16 02:31--03:04** — **The corrected post-commit run completes, but independent audit
  rejects its evidence protocol.** Scientific commit `a9c1f53` produced an internally passing 892,632-byte mode-0444
  artifact: five public cells are state/motor 83,521/83,521, all 15 decisive cells are state 83,521/83,521 versus
  motor 4,913/83,521, depth nine falls to 4,913/83,521, all 33 internal gates are true, and two embedded cores each
  contain 337 role records. File SHA-256 is
  `4f63123028fe33717981d026ca4accc854943400a502e56698ff040145a2ab0d`; payload SHA-256 is
  `9fa2a1fef402f4751a115f4597ff113f764b0654e19fc608bf93a64d2a2f3c59`. A fresh adversarial audit returned NO-GO:
  self-hash-consistent mutations can forge invocation evidence through `verify_report`; role processes can traverse
  the shared temporary parent; the deterministic manifest makes the challenge predictable before phase one; and the
  completed result had not yet been content-anchored. The artifact was moved intact to
  `artifacts/r12/post_commit_packet_transport_v2_postcommit_no_go_a9c1f53.json`. Do not cite it as a v2 pass. Repair
  with an OS filesystem sandbox, a parent-generated random nonce frozen only after phase one, and a separate verifier
  that recomputes every chain/score/invocation field. GPU remains unrestricted, but no neural fit is authorized yet.

- **2026-07-16 03:04--06:41** — **V3 survives three adversarial repair rounds and a full
  current-source integration, but remains precommit evidence only.** The repair replaces finite path blacklists with
  default-denied filesystem/network confinement around a root-owned protected Python runtime; role processes receive
  exact executable, input, and cwd grants. The parent generates and commits a fresh nonce only after immutable phase
  one, has no caller nonce surface, and cannot write canonical outputs. The independent implementation reconstructs
  every byte of all 337 role records, every affine chain, score, collision witness, decoy, sandbox probe, replay hash,
  and publication receipt before it alone may publish. Review found and fixed broad runtime reads, caller-controlled
  nonce semantics, missing receipt mutation tests, a stale parent sandbox schema, a byte-different claim boundary,
  and stale nonce terminology. A cross-implementation regression now compares every duplicated public contract
  constant while preserving implementation independence. All 38 adversarial tests, Ruff, compilation, and diff checks
  pass. The full precommit integration executes two byte-identical 337-role cores and 27/27 sandbox probes; each core
  payload SHA-256 is `f545653cef9bdcdc9e384b59168a3be3b1ad0fd9e3a47ecf337361af588a8be2`, final payload
  SHA-256 is `aca7e38833c7dfb342e171d6fe05525fb0764f3e6a768110f977e887c9ccee04`, and independent
  reconstruction passes. Because the run used an all-zero synthetic commit identity over current hashes, it is not a
  canonical result and wrote no artifact. Commit unchanged scientific paths, then execute and audit the commit-bound
  canonical publisher before authorizing a learned packet lane.

- **2026-07-16 06:42--07:01** — **The first v3 commit-bound execution fails closed at the
  independent publication boundary and adds defect 21.** Commit `5903fbf` completed both exhaustive cores, but the
  parent launched the verifier from a fresh audit cwd while passing the canonical artifact path exactly as the
  relative CLI argument. The verifier correctly rejected the path as noncanonical before creating the artifact or
  receipt. The repair resolves both output paths before child launch, and the existing delegated-publication test now
  passes relative paths while asserting the child command contains only their absolute frozen resolutions. All 38
  adversarial tests, Ruff, and compilation pass. Because this changes a scientific path, commit it before another
  canonical attempt; do not treat the completed cores from the failed attempt as evidence.

- **2026-07-16 07:01--07:19** — **Commit-bound PCPT v3 passes and is independently published.**
  Scientific commit `36906818f17aa4f03b9f5622dbcb65110ae95abf` completed the canonical command with two
  byte-identical cores at SHA-256 `fd212c4a648356dece649ff49d32a2a685c2d00ff2a25cc9cb321dd0e0e3102b`.
  All 35 frozen gates and 27 sandbox probes pass; five public cells preserve state and motor at
  83,521/83,521, while 15 decisive cells preserve state at 83,521/83,521 and collapse the answer-specific motor to
  4,913/83,521. Depths one, two, four, and eight are exact; depth nine collapses to 4,913/83,521. The independently
  implemented verifier required Git identity, reconstructed all 337 role records per core, and alone published the
  2,273,380-byte mode-0444 artifact (SHA-256
  `6f3846d6a58bca7d61e753fe1297c9f7090c29ef44f7585716a206dca3bba685`) and 1,232-byte mode-0444 receipt
  (SHA-256 `55de668bdf4f98b04ad0ce7d20b4e4b06baa53332f2e66b004076fe2b61d63f2`). A fresh
  `verify-publication` invocation also passes. This closes the exact process/algebra gate only. It proves no neural
  learning, language reasoning, or novelty. The next admissible work is a separately preregistered minimal learned
  categorical workspace with matched controls, followed only on transport success by autonomous operator/halting
  experiments and fresh researcher-written interaction.

- **2026-07-16 07:19--07:45** — **A final read-only adversarial replay promotes PCPT v3 from an
  internally consistent artifact to closed GO evidence.** The reviewer reran all 38 focused tests, replayed the
  Git-bound `verify-publication` path, inspected both read-only files, and independently forged score cells in both
  embedded cores while recomputing their local hashes. The verifier rejected the self-consistent forgery. The
  artifact and receipt hashes remain unchanged. Git stores the files as mode 100644 even though the working-tree
  copies are mode 0444, and historical wall-clock/entropy provenance is not attested; neither changes the bounded
  algebra/process claim. PCPT proves that a complete reusable state packet can survive process-separated source
  deletion and post-commit challenges while an equal-width answer motor collapses. It still proves no learnability,
  autonomous control, language reasoning, or novelty.

- **2026-07-16 07:45--08:40** — **The first architecture-changing learned lane is preregistered and
  reaches a full precommit mechanics PASS; no neural result exists yet.** `R12_ADDRESSED_CATEGORICAL_WORKSPACE_PREREG.md`
  freezes Track S Addressed Categorical Workspace (ACW): a three-symbol `F_17` packet, exact one-register writes,
  source deletion, and collision-guided terminal supervision. The CPU treatment has 26,008 trainable parameters;
  the eventual frozen-Shohin sidecar would add 92,953 parameters (0.07431% of the immutable base). Equal-label
  controls include dense categorical recurrence, addressed continuous state, GRU, packet-token recurrence,
  answer motor, uniform-query ACW, a 166,801-parameter source-retained upper bound, direct-state ACW, and exact
  compiled sparse state. Three sealed confirmation seeds remain only in macOS Keychain behind published
  commitments. Two review rounds returned GO on the theorem, confirmation custody, exact 57,344-label schedule,
  and repaired edge cases. Implementation now enforces accepted-depth quotas, disjoint post-freeze consumers,
  seed/domain/Git bindings, a one-use pilot ledger, oracle-free trainer bundles, direct trajectory supervision,
  frozen donor/shuffle/event-word/new-reader evaluation, and explicit resource ledgers. All 49 focused tests, Ruff,
  compilation, and diff checks pass. A full-field precommit canary and an independent implementation both reconstruct
  222,917,549 state-event updates; precommit payload SHA-256 is
  `5d71f31398a378ebb48fed7c094da243cac7c06e93a3a95b5e8d8cdf0e3c1413`, but it has no result standing. Commit the
  scientific paths unchanged, rerun the exhaustive Git-bound publisher/auditor, then execute the single authorized
  non-scored pilot. No scored CPU arm, confirmation opening, Shohin fit, H100 job, memory claim, or reasoning claim
  is authorized before those gates.

- **2026-07-16 08:40--09:35** — **A third adversarial review blocks the pilot, and the entire
  scientific path is revised before any learned execution.** The reviewer found seven claim-blocking defects:
  canonical provenance could fail open, the compiled sparse comparator read final state rather than replaying
  events, confirmation custody was not machine-enforced, the evaluator was not bound to its executing Git blobs,
  resource accounting omitted complete update/inference measurements, no independent adjudicator existed, and
  the uniform-query arm/state-split contract was inconsistent. The pilot remained unclaimed and no model was fit.
  Revision 2 closes those boundaries: exact scientific-path Git verification plus pushed-HEAD admission; an
  exclusive mode-0444 one-use pilot/confirmation ledger claimed before secret access; exact confirmation registry
  and selection-hash validation; event-by-event compiled sparse replay; full optimizer-update and inference resource
  profiles; thirteen label-efficiency checkpoints; deterministic byte-identical evaluator replay; and a separate
  immutable adjudicator over the complete arm/seed matrix. State splits now use the preregistered
  `SHA256(seed_material || canonical_state)` rule, and `uniform_query_acw` is one logical ID everywhere. All **66**
  focused tests, Ruff, Python compilation, shell syntax, and diff checks pass. A new theorem document,
  `R12_GOAL_CONDITIONED_VERSION_SPACE_CONTROLLER_PREREG.md`, proves why Track S transport cannot imply reasoning
  and freezes the later Track C test: the controller itself must commit `PROBE`, write, and `HALT` choices before
  receiving consequences. Its fixed-schedule and source-motor ceilings are exactly 5/16 and 1/16. A fresh read-only
  GO/NO-GO review is now running; the non-scored Stokes pilot remains held until it returns GO and the repaired
  scientific paths are committed and pushed. No learned result exists yet.

- **2026-07-16 09:35--09:45** — **The promised fresh replay returns NO-GO and supersedes the
  optimistic closure language above; the pilot remains unrun.** The reviewer constructed the decisive P0 attack:
  the adjudicator's own synthetic fixture uses nonexistent one-byte arrays, invented scientific identities, and
  invented scores yet reaches GO because the adjudicator never loads a checkpoint or dataset array and treats two
  copied reports as independent evidence. It also confirmed that the freezer can accept a relabeled self-hashed
  manifest, canonical pilot hyperparameters are caller-accessible, a mode-0444 ledger can be unlinked from its
  writable parent, keychain retrieval can bypass `main()`, confirmation authorization does not parse selection or
  fully replay training bindings, and zero resource measurements are accepted as complete. Event-by-event compiled
  sparse replay, executing-file Git binding, exact state bucketing, `uniform_query_acw` naming, and the explicit
  Track-S-not-reasoning boundary are closed. Stokes is reachable and idle at commit `b3aca2a`; no v2 pilot domain,
  schedule, model, ledger, or scored artifact has been created there. Repair now requires actual checkpoint/array
  replay in adjudication, deterministic generator replay rather than manifest trust, a reproducible fixed pilot
  rather than a false one-use claim, future-public confirmation entropy or an explicit residual-trust boundary, and
  fail-closed measured resource inventories. Do not commit or launch the current v2 lane.

- **2026-07-16 09:45--10:12** — **The five pilot-custody blockers are repaired; a new pilot-only
  adversarial review is running and no learned execution has occurred.** Canonical pilot and development domains
  are regenerated from registered public seed material and every public/oracle array is byte-compared before use;
  relabeled pilot data and self-hashed truth mutations reject. The pilot now consists of two isolated exact-config
  replays whose reports and both schedules must be byte-identical before a v3 comparison artifact freezes; the false
  unlinkable one-use ledger is gone. Adjudication v3 opens and hashes each actual dataset tree, trainer bundle, and
  checkpoint, validates model tensors and transitive bindings, and launches a fresh evaluator process; the prior
  one-byte-array / invented-score fixture no longer reaches GO. Train/inference profiles now include a complete
  sorted operator inventory, reconciled profiler event counts, FLOPs, allocations, and explicit zero-FLOP operator
  names. The static Keychain confirmation design is retired: both public generator entry points reject confirmation
  identities until a commit-bound future NIST Beacon opener exists. A deployed-format Beacon verifier now checks an
  archived signed pulse, certificate ID, output hash, previous link, and precommitment reveal, but it is only a
  prerequisite and does not authorize confirmation. All 80 integrated focused tests, Ruff, Python compilation,
  shell syntax, and diff checks pass. Await the independent verdict before commit or Stokes launch; even a GO would
  authorize only the non-scored public pilot, not development scoring, confirmation, Shohin integration, memory, or
  reasoning claims.

- **2026-07-16 10:12--10:40** — **The fresh pilot review returns NO-GO on fabricated execution;
  canonical execution ownership and independent recomputation are now implemented, pending rereview.** The reviewer
  showed that `publish_pilot` plus two caller-supplied identical reports could manufacture valid execution receipts
  without running data generation or training; the freezer checked internal hashes but did not reproduce the claimed
  model fit. It also found that clean status did not prove working bytes equaled Git blobs or that HEAD was pushed,
  and that canonical execution receipts did not require measured host/runtime/scheduler evidence. The repair removes
  caller-owned canonical freeze from the CLI. `pilot-run` now starts only from absent canonical paths, generates and
  replay-verifies the pilot dataset, launches replay A and B as distinct child processes, then reruns the entire
  deterministic fit inside the freezer and byte-compares the model tensor hash, loss transcript, schedules, report,
  and regenerated arrays before publication. Receipts require positive elapsed time/RSS, process and host identity,
  Python/Torch/NumPy versions, allocated CPUs, numeric Slurm job ID, and a hash-bound live `scontrol show job`
  snapshot. Scientific identity compares every working scientific file to `git show HEAD:<path>` and requires HEAD
  equal `origin/main`. A latent trainer-bundle split is corrected from mixed v2/v3 to v3 everywhere. The exact
  fabricated-without-training regression now rejects; 84 focused tests, Ruff, compilation, shell syntax, and diff
  checks pass. This is still precommit and unreviewed. Do not commit or launch Stokes until a fresh adversarial GO.

- **2026-07-16 10:40--11:18** — **The next reproducibility review finds two remaining P0s;
  live-child custody and bundle-v3 parity are repaired, with a new rereview running.** The reviewer confirmed that
  data/model/report recomputation is now strong, but demonstrated that `_validate_execution` still accepted a
  fabricated historical PID, one-nanosecond runtime, one-KiB RSS, and self-hashed `scontrol` text. It also showed the
  v3 bundle builder emitted `data_replay_verification` and two pilot-comparison hashes that the adjudicator's exact
  schema rejected; all 84 tests had missed the real producer/consumer mismatch. The repair removes the public
  `publish_pilot(... execution_context=...)` surface. The canonical parent now starts both child fits concurrently
  behind inherited release pipes, waits for atomic output, and holds both processes alive. Before and after its own
  full deterministic fit, the parent verifies each real PID and PPID through `/proc`/`ps`, matches the child's
  execution file, re-queries the running Slurm job, parses `JobId`, `JobState`, `NumCPUs`, and `NodeList`, reconciles
  wall and monotonic duration, and checks the exact Git identity. Only then does it release both children and require
  zero exits. Historical execution receipts are explicitly operational provenance rather than remote attestation;
  durable numerical standing comes from mandatory fresh consumer recomputation. Bundle v3 keys and data-replay
  semantics now match across builder/trainer/adjudicator, and a real builder-produced manifest is schema-compared in
  tests. The integrated suite is 87/87, including real live-child parentage, stale-Slurm rejection, full-bundle
  validation, and canonical runner/reopen call-graph tests. No pilot, development score, or model fit has run.

- **2026-07-16 11:18--11:29** — **Fresh adversarial rereview returns explicit GO for the non-scored
  public Track S pilot only.** The reviewer found no P0/P1 defect under the revision-3 trust boundary. It independently
  reran all 87 focused tests with `ResourceWarning` promoted to an error, exercised the real inherited-release-pipe
  child lifecycle, confirmed bundle-v3 producer/validator parity, and passed `git diff --check`. The canonical parent
  owns absent-path generation, launches both fits, binds each live PID/PPID and Slurm allocation, recomputes all 3,400
  updates before release, requires zero child exits, and every consumer rederives the numerical result. Exact working
  bytes are compared with `HEAD` blobs and `HEAD` must equal `origin/main`; therefore the current dirty checkout
  correctly fails scientific identity. Authorization is narrowly staged: commit and push these exact reviewed bytes,
  rerun the complete gate suite on that clean commit, then launch exactly one public Stokes pilot. This is not GO for
  development scoring, confirmation opening, Shohin integration, H100 use, a memory result, or a reasoning claim.

- **2026-07-16 11:29--11:42** — **A second independent reviewer supersedes that GO with a fourth
  public-pilot NO-GO; trainer-bundle v4 closes the new schedule/artifact binding defect.** Although the actual pilot
  execution/recomputation path remained sound, bundle v3 only syntax-checked its query-schedule and pilot digests.
  The adjudicator did not derive the selected schedule from `curriculum.jsonl` or open the referenced pilot files,
  and the trainer accepted only a subset of the v3 schema. A self-hashed replacement could therefore preserve local
  consistency without proving it consumed the frozen pilot schedule. V4 is fail-closed: the bundle contains exact
  copies of `report.json`, `replay_comparison.json`, `cgb_schedule.jsonl`, and `uniform_schedule.jsonl`; both trainer
  and independent adjudicator open and hash all four, validate the two payload bindings and recomputation registry,
  and derive `query_schedule_sha256` from every canonical consumed curriculum row. The trainer requires every v4 key
  and full development replay binding before fitting. A canonical small builder-to-trainer round trip and a
  self-consistently rehashed unbound-schedule attack are now regressions. All 88 focused tests pass. The pilot remains
  held until a fresh adversarial review returns GO on these exact v4 bytes.

- **2026-07-16 11:42--11:49** — **The reviewer who found the v3 defect returns GO on repaired v4,
  with no P0/P1/P2 findings for the non-scored public pilot.** Its fresh stable run passes all 88 tests. It confirms
  exact fifteen-field trainer schema enforcement, exact nested registries, complete development replay bindings,
  zero oracle exports, four opened pilot artifacts, curriculum-derived schedule hashes in both trainer and independent
  adjudicator, selected-schedule equality, pilot comparison/recomputation cross-binding, and scientific-identity
  equality. This authorizes only staging, committing, and pushing the exact reviewed files, rerunning on a clean
  pushed identity, then launching one public Stokes pilot. It does not authorize any scored arm or capability claim.

- **2026-07-16 11:49--11:56** — **A coordinated-substitution attack supersedes that GO with the
  fifth NO-GO; the phase boundary is narrowed and every post-pilot bundle path is now hard-blocked.** The reviewer
  changed all round-12 queries, regenerated the curriculum, selected schedule, report, replay comparison, artifact
  registry, and bundle hashes, retained the original scientific identity, and both trainer/adjudicator structural
  validators accepted. This proves that copied self-consistent evidence is not an external commitment. The honest
  public pilot itself is unaffected: it still generates, executes two held-live fits, independently recomputes, and
  reopens from a clean pushed commit. Instead of fabricating a pre-result anchor, production `build_trainer_bundle`,
  `load_public_training_data(..., reject_oracle=True)`, and adjudicator bundle validation now fail closed pending a
  second Git commit that anchors the exact verified pilot artifact registry after the pilot exists. Structural v4
  validation remains internal test machinery only. The full 89-test suite passes, including explicit production
  `external anchor` / `pilot_anchor_required` rejection and a Stokes command allowlist that excludes all bundle,
  trainer, and adjudicator invocations. Request a fresh verdict only for one public pilot with no
  downstream bundle authorization.

- **2026-07-16 11:56--12:03** — **Two fresh reviews return GO on the narrowed phase boundary,
  including the reviewer who built the coordinated-substitution attack.** Both directly probed builder API/CLI,
  trainer CLI, and adjudicator validation; every production route rejected before output with the external-anchor
  guard. They confirmed that underscore-prefixed unanchored structural helpers have no production callers and that
  the Stokes job executes only the 89-test gate, `pilot-run`, `verify-pilot`, and artifact-existence checks. The
  canonical pilot still requires absent paths, a clean pushed scientific identity, registered data regeneration,
  two parent-observed live children, live Slurm reconciliation, full pre-release recomputation, atomic freeze, final
  reopening, and another independent recomputation. GO authorizes staging the exact current files, commit/push to
  `origin/main`, a clean rerun, and one non-scored public pilot only. It grants no downstream training or claim.

- **2026-07-16 12:03--12:16** — **The exact reviewed Track S source is committed, pushed, installed
  on Stokes, and the sole public pilot is live as job `740041`.** The 17 intended scientific files were committed as
  `0b7299910f8c22bb4b0df12749b34eda9343aa21` and pushed to GitHub `origin/main`; the pushed-identity suite passed all
  89 tests in 15.166 seconds with Ruff, formatting, compilation, shell syntax, and diff gates clean. An incremental
  bundle installed that exact commit in `~/shohin_acw`; both Stokes `HEAD` and its bundle-backed `origin/main` resolve
  to the same commit, while unrelated local research files remain untouched. Preflight found no queued duplicate and
  no canonical pilot data, replay, or output path. Slurm accepted job `740041`, which began on CPU node `ec50` at
  12:11:10 EDT with four CPUs, 32 GiB, and a 24-hour limit. The first live inspection found the exact unittest process
  beneath the batch shell, a thawed Slurm cgroup, the expected CPU set, and slowly advancing page/CPU counters during
  shared-Lustre startup; the output log remained empty and no canonical artifact existed. Continue monitoring rather
  than infer a result. This launch authorizes no development arm, confirmation opening, Shohin sidecar fit, H100 run,
  memory claim, or reasoning claim.

- **2026-07-16 12:16--12:43** — **Stokes job `740041` fails closed in the unit-test gate; the
  environment-dependent negative control is isolated and repaired before resubmission.** Job accounting records
  `FAILED`, elapsed 18:18, exit `1:0`, and batch MaxRSS 624,744 KiB. The shared Lustre Python startup was slow, then
  the gate ran all 89 tests in 455.019 seconds. Exactly one test failed:
  `test_two_independent_replays_freeze_only_when_byte_identical` expected canonical validation of deliberately
  non-Slurm receipts to raise, but its noncanonical replay constructors inherited the real numeric `SLURM_JOB_ID`,
  queried the live allocation, and wrote valid Slurm evidence. That made the negative control environment-dependent.
  No canonical dataset, replay, schedule, report, or model artifact exists, and `pilot-run` never started. The test
  now explicitly blanks `SLURM_JOB_ID` only while constructing its non-Slurm receipts; production execution code is
  unchanged. The focused regression passes, the complete 89-test suite passes locally in 15.749 seconds, Ruff and
  format checks pass, and `git diff --check` is clean. Commit/push this bounded repair, install the exact replacement
  identity on Stokes, re-confirm absent canonical paths, and submit one replacement public pilot. No downstream arm
  or claim is authorized.

- **2026-07-16 12:43--13:20** — **Replacement `740053` completes, but independent cross-runtime
  replay finds and closes a one-ULP portability defect before anchoring.** The replacement ran on Stokes `ec52`,
  passed its full 89-test gate in 106.379 seconds, executed two distinct held-live child fits, independently
  recomputed all 3,400 updates in the parent, froze and reopened the result, and passed a separate `verify-pilot`.
  It completed `0:0` after 22:36. The complete 80-file / 23,949,312-byte mirror matches remote SHA-256 values;
  frozen outputs remain directory mode 0555 and file mode 0444. Same-runtime replay A/B reports and schedules are
  byte-identical. A fresh Mac replay nevertheless rejected `oracle/adaptation/source_features.npy`. Exhaustive
  comparison found all 59 integer/state/query arrays exact and only eight float32 feature arrays different, each
  by at most one ULP. Projection matrices themselves match across Python 3.13/NumPy 2.5 on Stokes and Python
  3.11/NumPy 2.3.5 on Mac. The sole cause is BLAS reduction order in one-hot matrix multiplication. Fixed-order
  float32 addition of the five event rows and three source rows produces identical Stokes/Mac hashes. Protocol v3
  now hardens these paths and makes v2 inadmissible; golden hashes cover all 48 events and all 4,913 source states.
  The integrated suite is now 90/90 with Ruff and formatting clean. Preserve `740053` only as process diagnostics;
  do not anchor or score it. Commit/push v3, independently compare complete Mac/Stokes regenerated manifests, then
  rerun the public pilot from absent paths. A separate audit also established the future anchor lineage must be
  scientific `S`, registry-only `A`, then activation `E`, each separately pushed and parent-bound.

- **2026-07-16 13:20--13:28** — **Generator v3 passes the mandatory full cross-runtime preflight;
  canonical pilot names advance so rejected artifacts cannot collide.** Scientific commit `f12e454` was pushed and
  installed on Stokes. Isolated Stokes job `740071` generated the complete pilot domain under Python 3.13 / NumPy
  2.5; the Mac independently generated it under Python 3.11 / NumPy 2.3.5. Both produce manifest payload SHA-256
  `3294a0d12d277f46ea8c0cbf50142be14816447c15bc3792f6e4df7e77e2ba33`; all 68 files and all 67 arrays are
  byte-identical. No tolerance is used. Before launch, the canonical paths advance from dataset v2/pilot v3 to
  dataset v3/pilot v4, and the pilot/comparison protocol IDs advance to v4. This prevents the rejected `740053`
  bytes from occupying an admissible namespace. The complete integrated suite remains 90/90 in 13.816 seconds;
  Ruff, formatting, shell syntax, compilation, and diff checks pass. Commit/push this namespace boundary, install
  exact HEAD, confirm all v3/v4 paths absent, and submit one public pilot only.

- **2026-07-16 13:28--14:25** — **Pilot v4 executes honestly but fails the independent runtime
  boundary; v5 is pre-result and no tolerance is permitted.** The first v4 submission `740074` failed safely in
  the test gate because Stokes `origin` still named an old incremental bundle; no artifact was created. After the
  canonical remote was repaired, `740077` completed on Stokes with 90 passing tests, two held child fits, parent
  recomputation, atomic freeze/reopen, and same-runtime verification. Its 80 files mirror exactly to the Mac. The
  report binds scientific commit `87ebf15`, dataset payload
  `3294a0d12d277f46ea8c0cbf50142be14816447c15bc3792f6e4df7e77e2ba33`, model tensor SHA-256
  `46e6f697f9938c089130b9251e8743d68ef98c38670bb3c484548f5f6c50ce4b`, CGB schedule SHA-256
  `5ff0647c25b0c8944053c75eee8ff9ad531018b6056d3e01eb1877a3e66ff177`, and uniform schedule SHA-256
  `d52578a8aca587c613f281e2f6c4aac847dbf297fb092d3d1d64c5a1f583e331`. Fresh Mac report replay then failed on
  `cgb_schedule.jsonl`: the model tensor changed and 43,451/57,344 schedule positions differed, with only 24,726
  rows common at the same positions; the uniform schedule remained byte-identical. This is material
  runtime-dependent float optimization, not the earlier one-ULP data defect. V4 is diagnostic-only and cannot
  become `S` or enter a scored arm. V5 now separates contracts: all dataset bytes retain cross-runtime exactness
  and an exact payload pin, while float fitting and fresh report replay require the exact Stokes Xeon Gold 6130 /
  glibc / interpreter / NumPy / Torch / native-library stack, deterministic algorithms, forced AVX2, one Torch
  compute thread, 32 interop threads, and no CUDA. Canonical paths advance to dataset
  `acw_pilot_domain_v3_runtime_v1` and pilot v5 and reject symlink components, symlink leaves, and every file or
  directory outside the exact manifest tree. Full compute probes `740100` on `ec51` and `740104` on `ec52`
  produced byte-identical pinned runtime identities; the complete local suite is 100/100. A separate verifier must
  freeze a hash-bound receipt from a different live Slurm job and node, while exact comparison schemas reject
  fabricated claims. Complete formatting, review, and clean pushed identity; run one v5 pilot on `ec51`, then
  independently replay it on `ec52` before the registry-only `A` commit. No scored or H100 work is open.

- **2026-07-16 14:25--17:15** — **V5 closes its runtime and receipt-custody boundary; still
  pre-result.** The canonical closure now binds 92 executable mappings, three complete code-tree summaries, 599
  imported external files, nine external tools, one path-independent generated PyTorch module, the exact five-entry
  `sys.path`, startup files, and native payload SHA-256
  `13c265e3f116beee105c883e6384595e5759f96419e790c064cd94e77f20425c`. Diagnostic probes `740196/740197`
  exposed a random generated-module temp path; `740203/740204` then failed closed because detachment happened before
  lazy module creation; `740205/740206` were canceled rather than misread after source placement changed. The
  repaired fresh pair `740207` on `ec51` and `740208` on `ec52` completed with byte-identical full identities, and
  final validators `740209/740210` each recomputed the identity twice and required exact equality to the compiled
  pin. All four successful logs have SHA-256
  `d989bafc4b8637d63375bc6107e26064ac0f3e09461e96a328042fe8c7fbdbc5`; stale or failed probes have no standing.
  Adversarial review then found two in-boundary P1 custody defects: receipt provenance was lost between verifier and
  registry processes, and the final registry reopen accepted noncanonical bytes. Both are repaired before `S`: the
  independent verifier and registry builder now execute as one Python command/process, the builder requires the
  exact receipt object and canonical bytes still held in memory, the standalone builder CLI and second batch command
  are removed, receipt substitution fails before anchoring, and receipt/registry publications are exact-byte checked
  and strict-canonical-JSON reopened. Regressions cover canonical substituted receipts, exact in-memory handoff,
  exact registry bytes, removed CLI route, and the one-command Stokes allowlist. The warning-strict eight-module gate
  is **114/114** in 13.391 seconds; Ruff, compilation, and verifier shell syntax are clean. The preregistration now
  states the real boundary explicitly: it trusts the committed process, Stokes kernel, Slurm, and filesystem during
  execution and makes no remote-attestation claim against a malicious same-UID actor that can execute substituted
  bytes and restore them. The same defect-finding reviewer reran the warning-strict suite, shell syntax, and diff
  checks and returned **GO** with no remaining P0/P1 blocker inside that boundary. This authorizes only a clean
  pushed `S` and one non-scored v5 pilot/replay chain; no registry anchor, scored arm, H100 run, or capability claim
  exists yet.

- **2026-07-16 17:15--18:01** — **The first v5 pilot fails closed on a real late native load;
  v6 closes and re-probes the boundary, still pre-result.** Commit `7110111` was pushed, installed exactly on
  Stokes, and launched once as job `740215` on `ec51`. Its 114-test gate passed in 85.586 seconds. It atomically
  generated the registered 68-file dataset and two four-file held replays, then the parent rejected its own required
  numerical recomputation before final freeze because the canonical runtime identity had changed. Accounting is
  `FAILED 1:0`, elapsed 15:06, MaxRSS 1,230,136 KiB; the 2,229-byte log SHA-256 is
  `91188af87a5ca5c7f3a5e44bfb6ef6d457d8429182859c95fcd49d52098a2653`. No final output, independent
  verification, artifact registry, score, or capability result exists. Read-only staged probe `740216` showed no
  mapping change through scientific identity, dataset verification, both replay validations, or replay byte
  comparison. Probe `740218` isolated the change: the first `socket.getfqdn()` loads exactly
  `/usr/lib64/libnss_files-2.28.so`, 54,360 bytes, SHA-256
  `3505f4d12bb803562270855de55c49aee3f63e5bd33fcd458d365c5cc99e441b`. The failed 76-file tree is
  quarantined intact at `artifacts/r12/rejected/740215`; every post-move hash verifies against a locally mirrored
  76-line manifest whose SHA-256 is
  `ebec7084fd14d382347786bc9d48a7cf55e8db5900357ece8c16a04107aae9f5`.

  The v6 repair calls `socket.getfqdn()` during runtime warmup, pins the NSS library, advances the dataset to
  `acw_pilot_domain_v3_runtime_v2`, advances pilot/execution/comparison to v6, orchestration and independent
  verification to v3, and the registry protocol/file to v2 / `R12_ACW_PILOT_ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_V2.json`. The new
  93-mapping native payload SHA-256 is
  `2c0605b4e60ecaf3d1a708c7124954b6f3c8405b0b23e75d59839588b32c2585`. Fresh read-only probes `740225`
  on `ec51` and `740224` on `ec52` both completed and produced byte-identical 23,901-byte logs, full structured
  identity SHA-256 `0e91de0e3dbca24ea4f04b9b03398a91486b93b31eff5a3ba4574dd43eaa677f`, and log SHA-256
  `708b7fc2165cf952389e4c9b07d1980c89af7cda3324995dcddd1035df81f7f9`. The local eight-module gate is
  **115/115** with `ResourceWarning` fatal, and Ruff, formatting, compilation, shell syntax, and diff checks pass.
  A fresh defect-finding review then traced warmup ordering, later runtime checks, all producer/consumer protocol
  bindings, canonical path absence, and both node probes. It returned **GO** with no P0/P1 finding for committing this
  exact replacement scientific candidate. Commit/push replacement `S`, install exact HEAD, run two-observation
  validators from that clean identity on both nodes, and only then relaunch one v6 pilot. No downstream arm or claim
  is open.

- **2026-07-16 18:12--19:05** — **Track S v6 becomes a verified non-scored execution baseline.**
  Scientific commit `S=5f5e3cd0d69da67335ad1f1f485c6e3d8f00ff8e` was pushed and installed exactly.
  Producer `740241` completed `0:0` on `ec51` after 33:25; independent verifier `740247` completed
  `0:0` on `ec52` after 22:15. The latter used a different job and node, freshly recomputed the pilot,
  and verified all 80 producer files before publishing the 81st anchored receipt. Receipt payload
  SHA-256 is `f72a40fe2dd84701bfa3f0ea92e3c2b463304861a063507ffb30c7909a6cfca0`; registry
  payload SHA-256 is `47f233a11db876f6ff26c1b4589a59d31c57bf4b2326b9ac5ffba00b81276cc5`.
  The pilot executed 4,096 histories, 57,344 labels, 12 refinement rounds, 3,400 optimizer updates,
  batch 256, and 43,853 charged candidate evaluations. Final loss moved 2.806958 -> 2.828255 and the
  model tensor SHA-256 is `1acc80d4362849d951fb45db34fb5c40c2cbf44a3cce4b7b2fa308b1923a1b94`.
  This proves deterministic execution/custody only; no score, generalization, or reasoning claim follows.

- **2026-07-16 19:05--19:25** — **The exact pilot bytes are mirrored and externally anchored.** All
  canonical artifact trees, the independent verification tree, producer/verifier logs, and spooled
  batch scripts were mirrored locally and rechecked by size, SHA-256, canonical JSON, and symlink
  rejection. Registry raw SHA-256 is
  `66597cf5381fdc11d4ecd73a93d9bbd2fa68417a77b09c1330ecfeb73652451c` and receipt file SHA-256 is
  `ea9b4966a827b35cbd03d8c1fe1e3226897dd96943376d6746196b2cce649792`. Registry-only commit
  `A=02c9d4ae57093b6c60d90580503e2a01c7c81619` adds exactly one file, is pushed to GitHub, and is
  installed byte-identically on Stokes. A is the sole child of S; it does not activate training.

- **2026-07-16 19:25--20:23** — **Activation and baseline retention are implemented locally, pending
  the final E commit.** Production bundle, trainer, and independent adjudicator now require the exact
  pushed `S -> A -> E` sole-parent chain, exact seven-file E allowlist, clean working bytes equal to E,
  and the 81-file registry. Scored checkpoints must carry E's identity and differ from pilot identity
  S. Checkpoint publication is exclusive-create, atomic, fsynced, mode 0444, and refuses existing or
  dangling-symlink destinations. A development-only manifest must verify all 24 scored checkpoints
  and three direct-state diagnostics before confirmation opens; the strongest deployable checkpoint
  is copied to a distinct immutable mode-0444 artifact and bound to every development artifact. Full
  adjudication refuses to run without that frozen record. Baseline selection considers deployable arms
  only and orders by median depth-64
  state exactness, median scalar accuracy, lexical arm ID, then per-checkpoint state/scalar/index.
  The source-retained upper bound remains preserved but cannot become the deployable baseline. Baseline
  status is independent of GO/NO_GO and cannot override promotion. Evaluator replay now uses stable
  in-memory checkpoint bytes, a private immutable dataset snapshot, a sanitized `-P -S` interpreter,
  and no inherited `PYTHONPATH`. Publication accepts only canonical GitHub or a verified commit-named
  offline bundle. The complete eight-module gate passes **122/122** warning-strict tests in 21.480
  seconds; Ruff, formatting, compilation, and diff checks are clean. Run the
  exact-diff audit, commit/push E, install it on Stokes, and execute the full anchor smoke before producing
  any scored development artifact.

- **2026-07-16 20:23--20:55** — **E is externally active; a late adversarial NO-GO is closed by
  custody successor F before scoring.** `E=38ebad21cf9c4ef98b172394891c2a35ef671b12` is the sole child
  of A and modifies exactly the seven activation files. It was pushed to GitHub, installed on Stokes
  from the exact mode-0444 bundle `/home/sa305415/shohin_acw_38ebad21.bundle` (84,776,490 bytes,
  SHA-256 `8760a023084ced85fb6f27c589d970ec5cd4f39768b4bad4e95bf904f267896d`), and its full
  anchor smoke independently opened and verified all 81 registered artifacts. A post-activation
  adversarial review then found a real scored-baseline P1: full confirmation evidence was verified
  before the development baseline validator ran, while that validator trusted embedded verification
  claims and required mode 0444 only for the copied checkpoint, not the baseline JSON. A concrete
  writable, empty-manifest forgery was accepted. No scored artifact existed, so no result was exposed
  or invalidated.

  F keeps E and every pilot byte fixed. Its exact five-file custody allowlist is this runbook, trainer,
  adjudicator, and their two focused test modules. The baseline validator now runs first, reads
  canonical mode-0444 baseline bytes through one stable descriptor, independently executes the entire
  development verifier over 24 scored checkpoints plus three direct-state diagnostics, reconstructs
  the selection rather than trusting embedded claims, and only then permits the full manifest to open.
  Full protocol v4 must bind the exact baseline file SHA-256, payload SHA-256, path, and immutable
  confirmation authorization; the manifest payload transitively binds all confirmation report
  references. The full development subset must still equal the independently replayed frozen subset.
  Regressions prove validation order, writable-baseline rejection, empty self-attestation rejection,
  exact full-manifest binding, and the strict `S -> A -> E -> F` lineage. The warning-strict
  eight-module gate passes **125/125** tests in 40.976 seconds; Ruff and formatting are clean. A
  fresh defect-finding re-review reran 81 targeted warning-strict tests, exercised mode/path/hash/
  payload/self-attestation substitutions, and returned GO with no remaining P0/P1 custody defect. F
  is pushed and installed as the sole child of E before any scored development artifact. The verified
  pilot remains the execution baseline; the first future complete development matrix will always
  preserve its best eligible checkpoint even if every promotion gate returns NO_GO.

- **2026-07-16 23:47--2026-07-17 01:12** — **The independent CDRL allocation hypothesis closes
  negative while the post-DRS probe changes the workspace diagnosis.** Grok's isolated Newton CDRL
  board `691750` completed `0:0` on evc22 in 3:25. Its immutable decision SHA-256
  `ad94ac15ca17eaa2c5381aa0a3f94fc60a49dbbf2a528552a1212b3ecf1cabdb` records `advance=false`:
  depth-OOD core-minus-full/hard medians are -0.776/-0.778 and core exactness is about 0.04 versus
  about 0.70--0.92 for full/hard histories. Do not retune pure Nerode-core allocation. Separately,
  post-DRS residual-swap job `691756` completed on evc33 and found 10/10 positive digit directions
  with about +31 delta-logodds at layers 17--29, plus a weaker carry channel at layer 29. This is a
  causal diagnostic that DRS induced a digit-bearing late residual; it does not show autonomous
  multi-step update, consumption, or reasoning. Typed-controller evaluation `691778` is parser-invalid
  for final accuracy because it could stop at the first arrow mid-integer. Corrected rescore `691782`
  runs independently on evc23; no corrected score is recorded yet.

- **2026-07-17 00:10--01:39** — **Track G scored-development custody is frozen and allocated held,
  still pre-result.** G adds a committed plan, exact four-stage producer/verifier orchestration, a
  fifth terminal-accounting monitor, independent semantic replay, exact closed-world consumer
  handoffs, retry-safe atomic publication, and a post-monitor anchor-ready envelope. Initial
  adversarial review found two real P1 classes: J5 could not account for itself, and consumer
  inventories disagreed about predecessor completion/accounting receipts; direct final-path writes
  also needed SIGKILL-safe publication. The repaired contract gives the monitor its own held Slurm
  job, includes terminal predecessor receipts only at successor handoff, and publishes via validated
  same-directory temporary bytes plus no-replace hard link. End-to-end regressions cover each issue.
  The final eight-module warning-strict gate is **143/143**; plan validation, Ruff, formatting,
  compilation, shell syntax, and diff checks pass. Two independent re-reviews return GO.

  The canonical plan raw SHA-256 is
  `39f91a28f4ac0a593ecabd19942e598a4474d777baccb7367d0bbfd73128335d` (payload SHA-256

  96 GiB each. `scontrol write batch_script` proves all four scientific jobs have main script
  SHA-256 `e75fb8c93c41d8fb6d0aae9e526d099bb130db6f0bfd6050034973dd06c3f087`; monitor `740342` has
  SHA-256 `b67bf5f1deb04015394d80f40138ae57125b8a843ef2612c481bcad256b44987`.
  Do not release any job until the exact G commit is pushed, installed cleanly on Stokes, and the
  complete suite/plan are revalidated there. These are custody facts only; no score or reasoning
  result exists.

- **2026-07-18 04:47--05:24** -- **G1 failed closed before any fit; G2 replaces it with fresh roots,
  identities, and corrected lineage accounting.** VPN and key-only Stokes access are restored. G1
  phase-one producer `740338` failed while building input bundles because the immutable F-to-G
  source ledger expected `pipeline/jobs/run_acw_terminal_monitor_stokes.sbatch` to be modified even
  though G correctly added it. No arm fit, scored checkpoint, development baseline, or performance
  report was produced. Dependency-dead `740339`--`740342` were canceled. The partial
  `artifacts/r12/acw_development_g1` namespace remains untouched as failed-attempt evidence.

  The narrow classifier repair now treats all six new development files as additions and all six
  inherited scientific files as modifications. Hostile tests reject wrong parent, extra/missing
  paths, renames, substitutions, and wrong status. Fresh G2 roots are
  `artifacts/r12/acw_development_g2`, `acw_development_g2_direct_verifier`, and
  `acw_development_g2_final_verifier`. Its structured canonical plan has raw SHA-256

  All five jobs remain `JobHeldUser`. Do not release them until full local and Stokes validation,
  hostile exact-byte review, a GitHub-backed sole-child-of-F G2 commit, an approved commit-bound offline bundle,
  and clean installation complete.
  No score or capability result exists.

- **2026-07-18 07:09--08:02** -- **Fresh hostile review returned NO-GO on two P1 custody
  defects; both are repaired locally, with the candidate still NO-GO pending rereview.** The
  private-refit report validator had checked digest syntax, internal string equality, and asserted
  booleans without reopening the producer/verifier private artifacts. It now reloads the exact
  committed plan, derives every producer and verifier path from its validated attempt table, opens
  each task/dataset/bundle beneath its plan root by directory file descriptor with `O_NOFOLLOW`,
  including an absolute root walk that rejects symlinked ancestors,
  and requires exact immutable registered trees. It independently recomputes checkpoint tensor/stable
  payload hashes, held-job execution receipts, evaluation normalization, replay equality, dataset
  equality, and bundle/curriculum equality. The submitted report comparisons must exactly equal the
  independently recomputed records. Canonical mode-0444 forged reports with valid-looking hashes and
  all positive booleans now fail when the checkpoint, evaluation, dataset, or bundle differs; a
  report-only digest forgery also fails.

  Atomic publication no longer catches directory-fsync errors. `EIO`, `EPERM`, and every other
  directory open/fsync error propagate, and fault injection proves publication cannot return success
  after a post-link directory-fsync failure. The focused builder/adjudicator gate passes **56/56**
  warning-strict tests; the complete eight-module gate passes **145/145** warning-strict tests in
  21.672 seconds. Ruff, formatting, compilation, shell syntax, staged diff checks, and final plan
  validation must remain green after exact restaging.

  Deterministic plan regeneration preserves the same held IDs `741070 -> 741071 -> 741072 ->
  741073 -> 741074` and is byte-identical: plan raw SHA-256

- **2026-07-18 08:02--09:21** -- **The bounded G2 four-finding custody repair is complete in the
  isolated worktree and remains COMMIT/INSTALL/RELEASE NO-GO pending a new independent review.**
  Every verifier role now carries an explicit `--verification-replay`; cross-contract tests construct
  both verifier receipts and require the adjudicator to accept them. The impossible origin/main
  identity condition is replaced by a dedicated `codex/acw-g2` contract: the eventual exact commit
  must have F as its sole parent, equal `refs/remotes/origin/codex/acw-g2` or the verified dedicated
  head in an exact commit-named offline bundle, and reject caller-selected branches, replacement
  refs, grafts, and history rewrite.

  A shared immutable publisher now owns every scientific evidence path consumed by this release:
  adjudicator decisions and authorizations, evaluation JSON, generated dataset arrays/directories,
  trainer curriculum bundles/directories, checkpoints, plans, manifests, and custody records. It uses
  unique exclusive staging, file fsync, bottom-up directory fsync, native atomic no-replace rename,
  parent-directory fsync, and final descriptor readback. Unexpected file or directory I/O failures are
  fatal. Focused tests inject interruption, destination collisions, file-fsync failures, and
  parent-directory-fsync failures; they also prove a competing destination is preserved.

  The exact G2 source ledger is seven additions and eleven modifications. The frozen plan raw SHA-256
  is `70eafa2de29f62ef6840764207440c8dde90f917cd7917f2613eaadd5081a430`; payload SHA-256 is
  `af9ffe97c15534971c6ee584af42d432e1ff7ab5c29fe380cd1e74065cd2d926`.
  It records `ready_for_g_commit=false`, denies commit/install/release authorization, and requires
  independent review. All ten existing jobs `741065`--`741074` remain held and must never be
  released. Neither held chain can execute these repaired bytes; any eventual reviewed release needs
  a fresh held allocation and exact plan refreeze. The complete warning-strict suite passes 172/172
  tests in 25.008 seconds. Ruff check, Ruff format check, Python compilation, both wrapper shell
  syntax checks, and diff checks pass. Plan validation reports `ready=0` across 27 attempts, while
  `--require-ready` fails with the frozen COMMIT/INSTALL/RELEASE NO-GO disposition. No commit, push,
  Stokes install, job operation, score read, or scored-artifact read occurred.
